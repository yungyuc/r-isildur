	abstract = {We propose an intuitive method, called the time-dependent population imaging (TDPI) method, to map the dynamical processes of high-order-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. It is shown that the real-time dynamical characteristics of HHG in solids, such as the instantaneous photon energies of emitted harmonics, can be read directly from the energy-resolved population oscillations of electrons in the TDPI picture. Meanwhile, the short and long trajectories of solid HHG are illustrated clearly from the TDPI picture. By using TDPI, we investigate the effects of the carrier-envelope phase in few-cycle pulses and demonstrate intuitively the HHG dynamics driven by two-color fields. Our results show that TDPI provides a powerful tool to study the ultrafast dynamics in strong fields for various laser-solid configurations and to gain insight into HHG processes in solids.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present work is to develop a new numerical framework for simulations involving deformable domains, in the specific context of high-order meshes consistent with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) representations. Thus, the proposed approach combines ideas from isogeometric analysis, able to handle exactly CAD-based geometries, and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, able to solve complex problems with moving grids. The resulting approach is a DG method based on rational Bézier elements, that can be easily constructed from Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), formulated in a general ALE setting. We focus here on applications in two-dimensional compressible flows, but the method could be applied to other models as well. Two verification exercises are conducted, to assess rigorously the properties of the method and the convergence rates for representations up to sixth order. Finally, three problems are analysed in depth, involving compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, for an oscillating cylinder and a pitching airfoil. In particular, the convergence of flow characteristics is investigated, as well as the impact of using curved boundaries in the context of deformable domains.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The book shows that commonly adopted special treatments in computational fluid dynamics and computational electromagnetics, such as upwinding, numerical dissipation, staggered grid, non-equal-order elements, operator splitting and preconditioning, edge elements, vector potential, and so on, are unnecessary.This book introduces the basic theory of the least-squares method for first-order PDE systems, particularly the div-curl system and the div-curl-grad system. It is applied to the study of permissible boundary conditions for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, to show that the divergence equations in the Maxwell equations are not redundant, and to derive equivalent second-order versions of the Navier--Stokes equations and the Maxwell equations.

	abstract = {A new numerical framework for solving conservation laws is being developed. This new framework differs substantially in both concept and methodology from the well-established methods, i.e., finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and spectral methods. It is conceptually simple and designed to overcome several key limitations of the above traditional methods. A two-level scheme for solving the convection-diffusion equation [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]t + a [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]x - [mu] [not partial differential]2u/[not partial differential]x2 = 0 ([mu] {\textgreater}= 0) is constructed and used to illuminate major differences between the present method and those mentioned above. This explicit scheme, referred to as the a-[mu] scheme, has two independent marching variables unj and (ux)nj which are the numerical analogues of u and [not partial differential]u/[not partial differential]x at (j, n), respectively. The a-[mu] scheme has the unusual property that its stability is limited only by the CFL condition, i.e., it is independent of [mu]. Also it can be shown that the amplification factors of the a -[mu] scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme if [mu] = O, and to those of the DuFort-Frankel scheme if a = O. These coincidences are unexpected because the a-[mu] scheme and the above classical schemes are derived from completely different perspectives, and the a -[mu] scheme does not reduce to the above classical schemes in the limiting cases. The a-[mu] scheme is extended to solve the 1D time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations of a perfect gas. Stability of this explicit solver also is limited only by the CFL condition. In spite of the fact that it does not use (i) any techniques related to the high-resolution upwind methods, and (ii) any ad hoc parameter, the current Navier-Stokes solver is capable of generating highly accurate shock tube solutions. Particularly, for high-Reynolds-number flows, shock discontinuities can be resolved within one mesh interval. The inviscid ([mu] = 0) a-[mu] scheme is reversible in time. It also is neutrally stable, i.e., free from numerical dissipation. Such a scheme generally cannot be extended to solve the Euler equations. Thus, the inviscid version is modified. Stability of this modified scheme, referred to as the a-[var epsilon] scheme, is limited by the CFL condition and 0 {\textless}= [var epsilon] {\textless}= 1, where [var epsilon] is a special parameter that controls numerical dissipation. Moreover, if [var epsilon] = 0, the amplification factors of the a-[var epsilon] scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme, which has no numerical dissipation. On the other hand, if [var epsilon] = 1, the two amplification factors of the a-[var epsilon] scheme become the same function of the Courant number and the phase angle. Unexpectedly, this function also is the amplification factor of the highly diffusive Lax scheme. Note that, because the Lax scheme is very diffusive and it uses a mesh that is staggered in time, a two-level scheme using such a mesh is often associated with a highly diffusive scheme. The a-[var epsilon] scheme, which also uses a mesh staggering in time, demonstrates that it can also be a scheme with no numerical dissipation. The Euler extension of the a -[var epsilon] scheme has stability conditions similar to those of the a -epsiv; scheme itself. It has the unusual property that numerical dissipation at all mesh points can be controlled by a set of local parameters, Moreover, it is capable of generating accurate shock tube solutions with the CFL number ranging from close to 1 to 0.022},

	abstract = {Memory access patterns are critical for performance, especially on parallel architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Because of this, the choice between an array-of-structures (AoS) data layout and a structure-of-arrays (SoA) layout has a large impact on overall program performance. However, it is not always obvious which layout will better serve a particular application, and testing both of them by hand in C++ is tedious because their syntax greatly differs. Not only is the syntax for defining the container different, but worse, the syntax for accessing the data within the container is different, leading to anywhere from tens to thousands of source code changes needed to switch any given container from the AoS to the SoA layout or vice versa. This chapter presents an abstraction layer that allows switching between the AoS and SoA layouts in C++ without having to change the data access syntax. A few changes to the structure and container definitions allow for easy performance comparison of AoS vs. SoA on existing AoS code. This abstraction retains the more intuitive AoS syntax (container[index].component) for data access yet allows switching between the AoS and SoA layouts with a single template parameter in the container type definition on the CPU and GPU. In this way, code development becomes independent of the data layout and performance is improved by choosing the correct layout for the application's usage pattern.},

Firedrake adopts the domain-specific language for the finite element method of the FEniCS project, but with a pure Python runtime-only implementation centered on the composition of several existing and new abstractions for particular aspects of scientific computing. The result is a more complete separation of concerns that eases the incorporation of separate contributions from computer scientists, numerical analysts, and application specialists. These contributions may add functionality or improve performance. Firedrake benefits from automatically applying new optimizations. This includes factorizing mixed function spaces, transforming and vectorizing inner loops, and intrinsically supporting block matrix operations. Importantly, Firedrake presents a simple public API for escaping the UFL abstraction. This allows users to implement common operations that fall outside of pure variational formulations, such as flux limiters.},

	abstract = {Scientific applications involve very large computations that strain the resources of whatever computers are available. Such computations implement sophisticated mathematics, require deep scientific knowledge, depend on subtle interplay of different approximations, and may be subject to instabilities and sensitivity to external input. Software able to succeed in this domain invariably embeds significant domain knowledge that should be tapped for future use. Unfortunately, most existing scientific software is designed in an ad hoc way, resulting in monolithic codes understood by only a few developers.  Software architecture refers to the way software is structured to promote objectives such as reusability, maintainability, extensibility, and feasibility of independent implementation. Such issues have become increasingly important in the scientific domain, as software gets larger and more complex, constructed by teams of people, and evolved over decades. In the context of scientific computation, the challenge facing mathematical software practitioners is to design, develop, and supply computational components which deliver these objectives when embedded in end-user application codes.  The Architecture of Scientific Software addresses emerging methodologies and tools for the rational design of scientific software, including component integration frameworks, network-based computing, formal methods of abstraction, application programmer interface design, and the role of object-oriented languages.  This book comprises the proceedings of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Conference on the Architecture of Scientific Software, which was held in Ottawa, Canada, in October 2000. It will prove invaluable reading for developers of scientific software, as well as for researchers in computational sciences and engineering.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in computational modeling is coupling models to solve multidisciplinary problems. Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

An academic researcher’s domain-specific knowledge often precludes that of software design, which results in inversion frameworks that are technically correct but not scalable to realistically sized problems. On the other hand, the computational demands for realistic problems result in industrial codebases that are geared solely for high performance, rather than comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new software design for inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations that bridges the gap between these two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and modular design reduces the cognitive burden on the user while exploiting high-performance primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying mathematics of the problem, which lowers the cognitive load on the user using it and reduces the initial startup period before a researcher can be fully productive. We also introduce a new preconditioner for the 3D Helmholtz equation that is suitable for fault-tolerant distributed systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on scaling algorithms from small- to large-scale problems with minimal code changes.},

	abstract = {Sparse tiling is a technique to fuse loops that access common data, thus increasing data locality. Unlike traditional loop fusion or blocking, the loops may have different iteration spaces and access shared datasets through indirect memory accesses, such as A[map[i]]—hence the name “sparse.” One notable example of such loops arises in discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods, because of the computation of numerical integrals over different domains (e.g., cells, facets). The major challenge with sparse tiling is implementation—not only is it cumbersome to understand and synthesize, but it is also onerous to maintain and generalize, as it requires a complete rewrite of the bulk of the numerical computation. In this article, we propose an approach to extend the applicability of sparse tiling based on raising the level of abstraction. Through a sequence of compiler passes, the mathematical specification of a problem is progressively lowered, and eventually sparse-tiled C for-loops are generated. Besides automation, we advance the state-of-the-art by introducing a revisited, more efficient sparse tiling algorithm; support for distributed-memory parallelism; a range of fine-grained optimizations for increased runtime performance; implementation in a publicly available library, SLOPE; and an in-depth study of the performance impact in Seigen, a real-world elastic wave equation solver for seismological problems, which shows speed-ups up to 1.28× on a platform consisting of 896 Intel Broadwell cores.},

The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the immersed boundary formulation using the indicator function. Our numerical methodology is first validated in comparison with theoretical results in purely Newtonian fluid, and then a series of numerical experiments is conducted to study the effects of different dimensionless parameters on the vesicle motions. Although the tank-treading (TT) motion of Newtonian vesicle in Oldroyd-B fluid under shear flow can be observed just like in Newtonian fluid, it is surprising to find that the stationary inclination angle can be negative without the transition to tumbling (TB) motion. Moreover, the inertia effect plays a significant role that is able to turn the vesicle back to positive inclination angle through TT-TB-TT transition as the Reynolds number increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first numerical work for the detailed investigations of Newtonian vesicle dynamics suspended in viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid. We believe that our numerical results can be used to motivate further studies in theory and experiments for such coupling vesicle problems.},

Both the backward Euler and Crank--Nicolson methods are introduced and it can be proved that the total energy, i.e., kinetic energy and bending energy, is discretely bounded.

In addition to the general challenges common to all software development projects, research software additionally must represent, manipulate, and provide data for complex theoretical constructs. Ensuring this process is robust is essential to maintaining the integrity of the science resulting from it, and the workshop highlighted a number of areas where the current approach to research software engineering would benefit from an evidence base that could be used to inform best practice. The workshop brought together expert research software engineers and academics to discuss the challenges of Theory-Software Translation over a two-day period. This report provides an overview of the workshop activities, and a synthesises of the discussion that was recorded. The body of the report presents a thematic analysis of the challenges of Theory-Software Translation as identified by workshop participants, summarises these into a set of research areas, and provides recommendations for the future direction of this work.},

	abstract = {In 1999, the Department of Trade and Industry in London commissioned a literature review of, and commentary on, the productivity paradox in information technology. This paper is derived from that report. The authors find that the discussion of the productivity paradox took place largely in the United States and particularly in Massachusetts. Two quite separate strands were evident: the literature of the economists, seeking ever-better methods of measurement, and that of management authors, seeking ever-better methods of management. This paper gives more attention to the latter than is customary, and concludes that the link between management methods and the requirements of IT may be closer than has hitherto been suspected. A combination of factors rather than a single factor is probably responsible for the disappointing productivity of IT. Within this combination, the problems that IT posed managers and the opportunities it offered management consultants are especially intriguing. 1999 gab das Department of Trade and Industry in London einen umfassenden Literaturüberblick über das Produktivitätsparadox in der Informationstechnologie in Auftrag. Der vorliegende Beitrag beruht auf diesem Projekt. Die Autoren stellten fest, dass die Diskussion des Produktivitätsparadoxons größtenteils in den Vereinigen Staaten und teilweise in Massachusetts stattfand. Zwei sehr unterschiedliche Betrachtungsansätze bestimmen die Produktivitätsparadox-Diskussion: Die volkswirtschaftliche Literatur forscht nach immer besseren Messmethoden, und die betriebswirtschaftliche Literatur beschäftigt sich mit der Suche nach immer besseren Managementmethoden. Der vorliegende Beitrag konzentriert sich hauptsächlich auf die zweite Betrachtungsweise. Als Schlussfolgerung ergibt sich, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Managementmethoden und Anforderungen der Informationstechnik weitaus enger ist als bisher angenommen wurde. Für die enttäuschenden Produktivitätswirkungen der Informationstechnik ist nicht ein einzelner Faktor, sondern wahrscheinlich eine Kombination von Faktoren verantwortlich. In dieser Kombination sind die Probleme, die sich Managern in der Nutzung von IT stellen, und die Betätigungsmöglichkeiten für Unternehmensberater besonders interessant.},

The gas-aluminum particle two-phase detonations are numerically investigated by the developed Eulerian-Lagrangian code, in which the gas-phase compressible Euler equations are solved by our in-house CE/SE scheme based on quadrilateral meshes. Additionally, the particle-phase Lagrangian equations, together with the stiff source terms of interphase interactions and chemical reactions, are explicitly integrated via the operator-splitting technique. A dynamic data structure is introduced to store particle information to overcome the tremendous communication costs when applying message passing interface parallel to the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. The code is shown to be of better parallel efficiency in moderate-scale computations than that uses static arrays. Comparisons with previous one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulation results and experimental observations are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the developed Eulerian-Lagrangian CE/SE code in gas-particle two-phase detonation simulations. Moreover, the code is also applied to simulate polydisperse gas-particle detonations which is close to a realistic scenario, and significant differences in detonation characteristics are found when compared with the monodisperse counterparts. The great demands of using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method to obtain more physics-consistent gas-particle detonation results are addressed, which the traditional Eulerian-Eulerian simulations fail to observe.},

The schemes for solving both scalar conservation laws and compressible Euler equations with shock waves are developed. They are accurate and robust with CFL widely ranging from 0 to nearly 1. In Euler solvers, the frequently-used Harten, Lax and van Leer (HLL) Riemann solver, contact discontinuity restoring HLLC Riemann solver and Roe Riemann solver are employed to calculate the upwind fluxes as examples. When standard grid-aligned Riemann solvers are employed, the carbuncle phenomena are significantly suppressed when comparing with conventional upwind schemes. If rotated Riemann solvers are employed, nearly carbuncle-free results are obtained. Several well understood numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate that the 2D characteristic CE/SE schemes can simultaneously capture shocks and details of complex flow structures very well.},

	abstract = {We present a Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamic method that is up to third-order accurate using subcell mesh stabilization (SMS) for compressible flows on quadratic meshes in two-dimensional (2D) Cartesian coordinates. Similar to the second-order accurate Lagrangian DG method with linear meshes, the physical evolution equations for the specific volume, velocity, and specific total energy are discretized using a modal DG method with Taylor series polynomials. The Riemann velocity at the vertices of a curvilinear cell, and the corresponding surface forces, are calculated by solving a multidirectional approximate Riemann problem. Curvilinear cells (e.g., quadratic quadrilateral meshes in this work) have many deformational degrees of freedom, and with these cells, they can deform in unphysical ways. Likewise, the Riemann solution at an edge vertex differs from the one at the corner of a cell. With SMS, each quadratic quadrilateral cell is decomposed into four quadrilateral subcells, that move in a Lagrangian manner. The edge vertex is surrounded by four subcells so that it is similar to the vertex at the cell corner. SMS can detect inconsistent density fields between the cell and subcells. The difference between these two density fields is used to correct the stress (pressure) input to the Riemann solver. This SMS scheme enables stable mesh motion and accurate solutions in the context of a Lagrangian high-order DG method that is up to third-order with quadratic cells. We also present effective limiting strategies that ensure monotonicity of the primitive variables with the high-order DG method. This Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method with SMS conserves mass, momentum, and total energy. A suite of test problems are calculated to demonstrate the designed order of accuracy (up to third-order accurate) of this method, and that the Lagrangian DG method using SMS preserves cylindrical symmetry on 1D radial flow problems with an equal-angle polar quadratic mesh.},

Founded on the principles of software essence (changeability, complexity, intangibility, and conformity), integrated development tools, and automated source code transformation. This new, agile approach takes change as a working unit devised to drive the entire development process, which is performed in a four-stage cycle. One of the most interesting approaches to apply change-driven development on scientific software is to update, modernize and even parallelize sequential programs that have been written 20 or 30 years ago and are still running in production environments.

	abstract = {Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Although Kriging offers a solution to this problem, it requires the prior specification of a kernel and it is not scalable to large datasets. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm ‖⋅‖ associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K1(Fn(x),Fn(x′)) with Fn+1=(Id+ϵGn+1)∘Fn and Gn+1∈span\{K1(Fn(xi),⋅)\}. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.},

The system is discretized in space by a C-grid staggering method, namely the TRiSK scheme adopted in MPAS-Ocean, a global ocean model with the capability of resolving multiple resolutions within a single simulation. The time integration is designed based on the strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta (SSP-RK) methods, but different time step sizes can be used in different regions of the domain through the coupling of coarse-fine time discretizations on the interface, and are only restricted by respective local CFL conditions. The proposed LTS schemes are of predictor–corrector type in which the predictors are constructed based on Taylor series expansions and SSP-RK stepping algorithms. The schemes preserve some important physical quantities in the discrete sense, such as exact conservation of the mass and potential vorticity and conservation of the total energy within time truncation errors. Moreover, they inherit the natural parallelism of the original explicit global time-stepping schemes. Extensive numerical tests are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

	abstract = {The field of high performance scientific computing lies at the crossroads of a number of disciplines and skill sets, and correspondingly, for someone to be successful at using high performance computing in science requires at least elementary knowledge of and skills in all these areas. Computations stem from an application context, so some acquaintance with physics and engineering sciences is desirable. Then, problems in these application areas are typically translated into linear algebraic, and sometimes combinatorial, problems, so a computational scientist needs knowledge of several aspects of numerical analysis, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics. An efficient implementation of the practical formulations of the application problems requires some understanding of computer architecture, both on the CPU level and on the level of parallel computing. Finally, in addition to mastering all these sciences, a computational scientist needs some specific skills of software management. While good texts exist on numerical modeling, numerical linear algebra, computer architecture, parallel computing, performance optimization, no book brings together these strands in a unified manner. The need for a book such as the present became apparent to the author working at a computing center: users are domain experts who not necessarily have mastery of all the background that would make them efficient computational scientists. This book, then, teaches those topics that seem indispensible for scientists engaging in large-scale computations. The contents of this book are a combination of theoretical material and self-guided tutorials on various practical skills. The theory chapters have exercises that can be assigned in a classroom, however, their placement in the text is such that a reader not inclined to do exercises can simply take them as statement of fact.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Deep learning has been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using computers. We introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D$^{\textrm{2}}$NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We create 3D-printed D$^{\textrm{2}}$NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products as well as the function of an imaging lens at terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can implement, and will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection and object classification, also enabling new camera designs and optical components that perform unique tasks using D$^{\textrm{2}}$NNs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This text is a concise introduction to the partial differential equations which change from elliptic to hyperbolic type across a smooth hypersurface of their domain. These are becoming increasingly important in diverse sub-fields of both applied mathematics and engineering, for example: • The heating of fusion plasmas by electromagnetic waves• The behaviour of light near a caustic• Extremal surfaces in the space of special relativity • The formation of rapids; transonic and multiphase fluid flow • The dynamics of certain models for elastic structures• The shape of industrial surfaces such as windshields and airfoils • Pathologies of traffic flow • Harmonic fields in extended projective space They also arise in models for the early universe, for cosmic acceleration, and for possible violation of causality in the interiors of certain compact stars. Within the past 25 years, they have become central to the isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds and the prescription of Gauss curvature for surfaces: topics in pure mathematics which themselves have important applications. Elliptic−Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations is derived from a mini-course given at the ICMS Workshop on Differential Geometry and Continuum Mechanics held in Edinburgh, Scotland in June 2013. The focus on geometry in that meeting is reflected in these notes, along with the focus on quasilinear equations. In the spirit of the ICMS workshop, this course is addressed both to applied mathematicians and to mathematically-oriented engineers. The emphasis is on very recent applications and methods, the majority of which have not previously appeared in book form.},

	abstract = {The theory of hyperbolic equations is a large subject, and its applications are many: fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, the theory of elasticity, optics, electromagnetic waves, direct and inverse scattering, and the general theory of relativity. This book is an introduction to most facets of the theory and is an ideal text for a second-year graduate course on the subject. The first part deals with the basic theory: the relation of hyperbolicity to the finite propagation of signals, the concept and role of characteristic surfaces and rays, energy, and energy inequalities. The structure of solutions of equations with constant coefficients is explored with the help of the Fourier and Radon transforms. The existence of solutions of equations with variable coefficients with prescribed initial values is proved using energy inequalities. The propagation of singularities is studied with the help of progressing waves. The second part describes finite difference approximations of hyperbolic equations, presents a streamlined version of the Lax-Phillips scattering theory, and covers basic concepts and results for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, an active research area today. Four brief appendices sketch topics that are important or amusing, such as Huygens' principle and a theory of mixed initial and boundary value problems. A fifth appendix by Cathleen Morawetz describes a nonstandard energy identity and its uses.

We then analyze the weak continuity and rigidity of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci system and corresponding isometric embeddings in differential geometry.

The approach is recursive in that fine grids can contain even finer grids. The grids with finer mesh width in space also have a smaller mesh width in time, making this a mesh refinement algorithm in time and space.

This new procedure allows for variation of time-step size in both space and time, and can also be extended to become multi-dimensional solvers with structured/unstructured spatial grids. Moreover, it differs substantially in concept and methodology from the existing approaches. By taking full advantage of key concepts of the CESE method, in a simple and efficient manner it can enforce flux conservation across an interface separating grid zones of different time-step sizes. In particular, no correction pass is needed. Numerical experiments show that, for a variety of flow problems involving moving shock and flame discontinuities, accurate and robust numerical simulations can be achieved even with a reduction in time-step size on the order of 10 or higher for grids across a single interface.},

A particular emphasis is on the tensor train (TT) and Hierarchical Tucker (HT) decompositions, and their physically meaningful interpretations which reflect the scalability of the tensor network approach. Through a graphical approach, we also elucidate how, by virtue of the underlying low-rank tensor approximations and sophisticated contractions of core tensors, tensor networks have the ability to perform distributed computations on otherwise prohibitively large volumes of data/parameters, thereby alleviating or even eliminating the curse of dimensionality. The usefulness of this concept is illustrated over a number of applied areas, including generalized regression and classification (support tensor machines, canonical correlation analysis, higher order partial least squares), generalized eigenvalue decomposition, Riemannian optimization, and in the optimization of deep neural networks. Part 1 and Part 2 of this work can be used either as stand-alone separate texts, or indeed as a conjoint comprehensive review of the exciting field of low-rank tensor networks and tensor decompositions.},

Taking the well-known inertial number I as a measure of sheared-induced local fluidization, we derive a relaxation model for I according to the evolution of microstructure during avalanche and dissipation processes. The model yields a nonmonotonic flow law for a homogeneous flow, accounting for hysteretic solid-fluid transition and intermittency in quasistatic flows. For an inhomogeneous flow, the model predicts a generalized Bagnold shear stress revealing the interplay of two microscopic nonlocal mechanisms: collisions among correlated structures and the diffusion of fluidization within the structures. In describing a uniform flow down an incline, the model reproduces the hysteretic starting and stopping heights and the Pouliquen flow rule for mean velocity. Moreover, a dimensionless parameter reflecting the nonlocal effect on the flow is discovered, which controls the transition between Bagnold and creeping flow dynamics.},

Research in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) in recent decades investigates how distributed, collaborative scientific projects take place across different geographical and temporal scales through the enactment of research infrastructures. This dissertation expands upon existing CSCW research with a qualitative, episodic study of a group of cosmologists who are themselves enacting and working among multiple research infrastructures by producing data analysis software as part of a multinational radio telescope project. I describe this cosmology group’s software production practices to explain how software is a material for expressing their scientific method. Software operationalizes and encapsulates their cosmology theory, a model of the telescope, observation data, and ongoing analysis decisions. I demonstrate how by using plots (visualizations of observation data, their software, and the physical telescope) they engage in rigorous and thoughtful testing and analysis of infrastructural components in their work. Doing this data-intensive scientific work requires that they collectively develop a deep understanding of multiple infrastructures to isolate and remove flaws in their data and do a high-precision scientific analysis, interrogating the many embedded relations among conventions of practice that make up their work. My dissertation offers a novel perspective on the production, use, and work of software in science that emphasizes that software in scientific research is not some static product to simply be sustained but a perpetually mutable expression of method to be iterated upon and improved through unfolding research work.},

We offer observations of how this type of scientist develops trustworthy software. We observe that these scientists work outside the ubiquitous method-based software development paradigms, using instead a knowledge acquisition-based approach to software development. We also observe that the scientist is an integral part of the software system and cannot be excluded from its consideration.

Associated software development efforts may be very large, long lived, and complex, requiring the commitment of significant resources. However, several authors have argued that the “gap” or “chasm” between software engineering and scientific programming is a serious risk to the production of reliable scientific results, as demonstrated in a number of case studies. This article reviews the research that addresses the gap, exploring how both software engineering and research practice may need to evolve to accommodate the use of software in science.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

One approach to this challenge is centered around the idea of in situ processing, where visualization and analysis processing is performed while data is still resident in memory. This paper examines several key design and performance issues related to the idea of in situ processing at extreme scale on modern platforms: scalability, overhead, performance measurement and analysis, comparison and contrast with a traditional post hoc approach, and interfacing with simulation codes. We illustrate these principles in practice with studies, conducted on large-scale HPC platforms, that include a miniapplication and multiple science application codes, one of which demonstrates in situ methods in use at greater than 1M-way concurrency.},

In the CESE method, the conservative variables and their spatial derivatives are regarded as the independent marching quantities, making the CESE method significantly different from the finite difference method (FDM) and finite volume method (FVM). To utilize the characteristics of the CESE method to the maximum extent possible, our proposed method based on the least-squares method fundamentally keeps the magnetic field divergence-free.

The goal is to achieve a coherent presentation of the relevant quantities to be measured i.e. flowing thresholds, kinematic profiles, effective friction, etc. First, a quantitative comparison between data coming from different experiments in the same geometry identifies the robust features in each case. Second, a transverse analysis of the data across the different configurations, allows us to identify the relevant dimensionless parameters, the different flow regimes and to propose simple interpretations. The present work, more than a simple juxtaposition of results, demonstrates the richness of granular flows and underlines the open problem of defining a single rheology.},

In smooth regions, the scheme applies the central nonlinear interpolation with minimum dissipation to resolve fluctuating flow features while in regions containing discontinuities and high wavenumber features, the scheme suppresses spurious numerical oscillations by hybridizing the central interpolation with the more dissipative upwind-biased nonlinear interpolation. In capturing material interfaces between species of different densities, a quasi-conservative five equation model that can conserve mass of each species is used to prevent pressure oscillations across the interfaces. Compared to upwind-biased interpolations with classical nonlinear weights [1,2] and improved weights [3], and the interpolation with adaptive central-upwind weights for scale-separation [4], it is shown that WCNS with the proposed localized dissipative interpolation has better performance to simultaneously capture discontinuities and resolve smooth features.},

By relying on the wavelength selectivity of an InGaN LED, we are able to detect the fast blue light components and reject the slow phosphor components from white light illumination, thereby increasing the modulation speed significantly from 5 MHz to 20 MHz. V-pit texturing is used to improve the peak responsivity of InGaN LEDs to 0.23 A/W at 380 nm, which is comparable with the highest values reported in InGaN detectors. Such V-pit structures also help to shield nonradiative recombination at threading dislocations, so that a high breakdown voltage of −40 V with a high bandwidth of 275 MHz can be obtained. This demonstrates the suitability of V-pit textured InGaN LEDs to function not only as a bright emitter but also as a highly responsive, fast photodetector. This dual functionality enables high-speed LED-to-LED communications, without the need for an extra photodetector.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the art of computer programming, the conceptual tools available for the design of programs, and the prevention of programming oversights and error. The initial outstanding contribution to our understanding of this subject was made by E. W. Dijkstra, whose Notes on Structured Programming form the first and major section of this book. They clearly expound the reflections of a brilliant programmer on the methods which he has hitherto unconsciously applied; there can be no programmer of the present day who could not increase his skills by a study and conscious application of these principles. In the second monograph I have tried to describe how similar principles can be applied in the design of data structures. I have suggested that in analysing a problem and groping towards a solution, a programmer should take advantage of abstract concepts such as sets, sequences, and mappings; and judiciously postpone decisions on representation until he is constructing the more detailed code of the program. The monograph also describes a range of useful ideas for data representation, and suggests the criteria relevant for their selection. The third monograph provides a synthesis of the previous two, and expounds the close theoretical and practical connections between the design of data and the design of programs. It introduces useful additional methods for program and data structuring which may be unfamiliar to many programmers. The examples show that structured programming principles can be equally applied in "bottom-up" as in "top-down" program design. The original inspiration, insight, and all the examples were contributed by O.-J. Dahl; I have only assembled the material, and added some additional explanations where I found it difficult to understand.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report a version of the space-time conservation element and solution element (CE/SE) method in which the 2D and 3D unsteady Euler equations are simulated using structured or unstructured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, respectively. In the present method, mesh values of flow variables and their spatial derivatives are treated as independent unknowns to be solved for. At each mesh point, the value of a flow variable is obtained by imposing a flux conservation condition. On the other hand, the spatial derivatives are evaluated using a finite-difference/weighted-average procedure. Note that the present extension retains many key advantages of the original CE/SE method which uses triangular and tetrahedral meshes, respectively, for its 2D and 3D applications. These advantages include efficient parallel computing, ease of implementing nonreflecting boundary conditions, high-fidelity resolution of shocks and waves, and a genuinely multidimensional formulation without the need to use a dimensional-splitting approach. In particular, because Riemann solvers--the cornerstones of the Godunov-type upwind schemes--are not needed to capture shocks, the computational logic of the present method is considerably simpler. To demonstrate the capability of the present method, numerical results are presented for several benchmark problems including oblique shock reflection, supersonic flow over a wedge, and a 3D detonation flow.},

It was designed to avoid the limitations of the traditional methods. and was built from round zero with extensive physics considerations. Nevertheless, its foundation is mathmatically simple enough that one can build from it a coherent, robust. efficient and accurate numerical framework. Two basic beliefs that set the new method apart from the established methods are at the core of its development. The first belief is that, in order to capture physics more efficiently and realistically, the modeling, focus should be placed on the original integral form of the physical conservation laws, rather than the differential form. The latter form follows from the integral form under the additional assumption that the physical solution is smooth, an assumption that is difficult to realize numerically in a region of rapid chance. such as a boundary layer or a shock. The second belief is that, with proper modeling of the integral and differential forms themselves, the resulting, numerical solution should automatically be consistent with the properties derived front the integral and differential forms, e.g., the jump conditions across a shock and the properties of characteristics. Therefore a much simpler and more robust method can be developed by not using the above derived properties explicitly.},

When the result of DDP–DOM along one-dimensional direction is compared with that along multi-dimensional directions, it is found that the result of the latter one has higher precision without considering the medium scattering. Meanwhile, an in-depth study of the convergence of DDP–DOM for radiation heat transfer is made. Analyzing the cause of the weak convergence, we relate the total number of iteration steps when the convergence is obtained to the number of sub-domains. When we decompose the spatial domain along one-, two- and three-dimensional directions, different linear relationships between the number of total iteration steps and the number of sub-domains will be possessed separately, then several equations are developed to show the relationships. Using the equations, some phenomena in DDP–DOM can be made clear easily. At the same time, the correctness of the equations is verified.},

In this article, the formulation of the discrete-ordinates method is described for computing radiative transfer in a one-dimensional (1D) slab and two-dimensional (2D) rectangular geometries, including the effects of absorbing, emitting and scattering constituents. Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this numerical approach are addressed. The accuracy of available results obtained by utilizing the discrete-ordinates method is compared with other methods of solution for several representative cases. It is evident that major advances have been made related to the development and application of the discrete-ordinates method in multi-dimensional systems.

The hybrid rocket is a combination of both the solid and liquid systems with half of the plumbing of the liquid rocket but retaining its operational flexibility and avoiding the explosive nature of the solid rocket. Among available hybrid systems, the N2O (Nitrous Oxide)–HTPB (Hydroxyl-Terminated PolyButadiene) hybrid propulsion represents the simplest but sufficiently efficient design. Unfortunately, even until now, research in developing hybrid N2O–HTPB propulsion system still strongly depends on trials-and-errors, which are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, detailed understanding of the fundamental combustion processes that are involved in the N2O–HTPB propulsion system can greatly impact the research community in this field. This may further facilitate the successful modeling of the combustion processes and help improving the design of N2O–HTPB propulsion system in the future.

In this paper we detail how PyFR has been extended to run on mixed element meshes, and a range of hardware platforms, including heterogeneous multi-node systems. Performance of our implementation is benchmarked using pure hexahedral and mixed prismatic-tetrahedral meshes of the void space around a circular cylinder. Specifically, for each mesh performance is assessed at various orders of accuracy on three different hardware platforms; an NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU, an Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU, and an AMD FirePro W9100 GPU. Performance is then assessed on a heterogeneous multi-node system constructed from a mix of the aforementioned hardware. Results demonstrate that PyFR achieves performance portability across various hardware platforms. In particular, the ability of PyFR to target individual platforms with their ‘native’ language leads to significantly enhanced performance cf. targeting each platform with OpenCL alone. PyFR is also found to be performant on the heterogeneous multi-node system, achieving a significant fraction of the available FLOP/s. Finally, each mesh is used to undertake nominally fifth-order accurate long-time simulations of unsteady flow over a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 3900 using a cluster of NVIDIA K20c GPUs. Long-time dynamics of the wake are studied in detail, and results are found to be in excellent agreement with previous experimental/numerical data. All results were obtained with PyFR v0.2.2, which is freely available under a 3-Clause New Style BSD license (see www.pyfr.org).},

	abstract = {Much research in Lagrangian staggered-grid hydrodynamics (SGH) has focused on explicit viscosity models for adding dissipation to a calculation that has shocks. The explicit viscosity is commonly called “artificial viscosity”. Recently, researchers have developed hydrodynamic algorithms that incorporate approximate Riemann solutions on the dual grid [28,29,35,30,2,3]. This approach adds dissipation to the calculation via solving a Riemann-like problem. In this work, we follow the works of [28,29,35,30] and solve a multidirectional Riemann-like problem at the cell center. The Riemann-like solution at the cell center is used in the momentum and energy equations. The multidirectional Riemann-like problem used in this work differs from previous work in that it is an extension of the cell-centered hydrodynamics (CCH) nodal solution approach in [7]. Incorporating the multidirectional Riemann-like problem from [7] into SGH has merits such as the ability to resist mesh instabilities like hourglass null modes and chevron null modes. The approach is valid for complex multidimensional flows with strong shocks. Numerical details and test problems are presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we take a different perspective on the derivation of artificial viscosity. Heretofore, the development of artificial viscosity has been based on the paper published in Journal of Applied Physics in 1950 authored by John von Neumann and Robert Richtmyer [1]. Earlier, in 1948, Richtmyer published a report at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory documenting the original concept [2]. This report was the true origin of shock capturing methods and contains several key ideas that are conceptually different than the 1950 journal article. Unfortunately, this report (LA-671) was classified until 1993. This has resulted in two issues: the misattribution of the invention of artificial viscosity as primarily being the work of von Neumann and the loss of the structurally different ideas in the original report. We seek to right the record of history here and use the ideas contained in Richtmyer's report to good effect in deriving a new shock viscosity. The focus of previous development has been the Hugoniot curve describing the locus of states connected by a single shock wave. Here we follow a path more focused upon the Rayleigh line, which is strongly guided by Richtmyer's line of development of the original artificial viscosity formulation. We provide an implementation of the method resulting from this perspective and computational results for simple shock problems. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Large eddy simulation (LES) is also conducted and results are compared against experimental measurements. In addition, the effects of rib thermal boundary condition on heat transfer are also investigated. In the present work, the blockage ratio of the transversely mounted rectangular ribs is 10\% and the rib pitch-to-height ratio of 9 is selected. The Reynolds number, based on the channel bulk velocity and hydraulic diameter, is 30,000. The RANS-based turbulence models investigated here are the k-ω-SST, the v2-f, the ϕ-f, and the elliptic blending RSM. All computations are undertaken using the commercial and industrial CFD codes STAR-CD and Code\_Saturne, respectively. Of all the models, the LES predictions were found to be in the best agreement with the experimental data, while the k-ω-SST and EB-RSM returned the least accurate results.},

We proposed a pressure–velocity based diffusion term original derived from AUSMD scheme of Wada and Liou in 1997 to enhance its robustness. The proposed AUSMD schemes have been applied to gas and liquid fluids universally to capture fluid discontinuities, such as the fluid interfaces and shock waves, accurately for the Ransom's faucet problem, air–water shock tube problems and 2D shock–water liquid interaction problems. However, the proposed scheme failed at computing liquid–gas interfaces in problems under large ratios of pressure, density and volume of fraction. The numerical instability has been remedied by Chang and Liou in 2007 using the exact Riemann solver to enhance the accuracy and stability of numerical flux across the liquid–gas interface. Here, instead of the exact Riemann solver, we propose a simple AUSMD type primitive variable Riemann solver (PVRS) which can successfully solve 1D stiffened water–air shock tube and 2D shock–gas interaction problems under large ratios of pressure, density and volume of fraction without the expensive cost of tedious computer time. In addition, the proposed approach is shown to deliver a good resolution of the shock-front, rarefaction and cavitation inside the evolution of high-speed droplet impact on the wall.},

	abstract = {The size of spatial scientific datasets is steadily increasing due to improvements in instruments and availability of computational resources. However, much of the research on efficient storage and access to spatial datasets has focused on large multidimensional arrays. In contrast, unstructured grids consisting of collections of simplices (e.g. triangles or tetrahedra) present special challenges that have received less attention. Data values found at the vertices of the simplices may be dispersed throughout a datafile, producing especially poor disk locality.

Our previous work has focused on addressing this locality problem. In this paper, we reorganize the unstructured grid to improve locality of disk access by maintaining the spatial neighborhood relationships inherent in the unstructured grid. This reorganization produces significant gains in performance by reducing the number of accesses made to the data file. We also examine the effects of different chunking configurations on data retrieval performance. A major motivation for reorganizing the unstructured grid is to allow the application of iteration aware prefetching. Applying this prefetching method to unstructured grids produces further performance gains over and above the gains seen from reorganization alone.

Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to “think like a vertex” (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.},

	abstract = {We present here a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of Lillgrund offshore wind farm, which is located in the Øresund Strait between Sweden and Denmark. The simulation combines a dynamic representation of wind turbines embedded within a large-eddy simulation CFD solver and uses hr-adaptive meshing to increase or decrease mesh resolution where required. This allows the resolution of both large-scale flow structures around the wind farm, and the local flow conditions at individual turbines; consequently, the response of each turbine to local conditions can be modelled, as well as the resulting evolution of the turbine wakes. This paper provides a detailed description of the turbine model which simulates the interaction between the wind, the turbine rotors, and the turbine generators by calculating the forces on the rotor, the body forces on the air, and instantaneous power output. This model was used to investigate a selection of key wind speeds and directions, investigating cases where a row of turbines would be fully aligned with the wind or at specific angles to the wind. Results shown here include presentations of the spin-up of turbines, the observation of eddies moving through the turbine array, meandering turbine wakes, and an extensive wind farm wake several kilometres in length. The key measurement available for cross-validation with operational wind farm data is the power output from the individual turbines, where the effect of unsteady turbine wakes on the performance of downstream turbines was a main point of interest. The results from the simulations were compared to the performance measurements from the real wind farm to provide a firm quantitative validation of this methodology. Having achieved good agreement between the model results and actual wind farm measurements, the potential of the methodology to provide a tool for further investigations of engineering and atmospheric science problems is outlined.},

	abstract = {Summary
A meshless numerical model is proposed to investigate shallow-water dam break flows in 1D open channels. The numerical model is to solve the shallow water equations (SWE) based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The concept of slice water particles (SWP) is adopted in the SPH-SWE formulation. The numerical sensitivity analysis is first performed to study the appropriate SWP number and variable smoothing length through dam break flows in an idealized 1D channel with dry/wet beds. Extensive validation by comparison with laboratory and field data is next conducted for four benchmark problems, including dam break flows through a rough flat channel, a rough bumpy channel with various downstream boundary conditions, a nonprismatic channel, and a realistic scale model of the Toce river in Italy. The simulated results indicate that accurate performance is reached in the presence of shock discontinuities, shock front motion, hydraulic jumps, dry/wet bed flow, supercritical/subcritical/transcritical flow, reverse flow, contraction flow, overtopping flow, partial reflections and multiple wave interaction without special numerical treatment. All of the simulations are carried out by PC within 10 min. Thus, the proposed numerical model has proved its efficiency and reliability for dam break flow computations in open channels.},

	abstract = {Application of the newly emerged space-time conservation element solution element (CESE) method to compressible Navier-Stokes equations is studied. In contrast to Euler equations solvers, several issues such as boundary conditions, numerical dissipation, and grid stiffness warrant systematic investigations and validations. Non-reflecting boundary conditions applied at the truncated boundary are also investigated from the stand point of acoustic wave propagation. Validations of the numerical solutions are performed by comparing with exact solutions for steady–state as well as time-accurate viscous flow problems. The test cases cover a broad speed regime for problems ranging from acoustic wave propagation to 3D hypersonic configurations. Model problems pertinent to hypersonic configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of the CESE method in treating flows with shocks, unsteady waves, and separations. Good agreement with exact solutions suggests that the space-time CESE method provides a viable alternative for time-accurate Navier-Stokes calculations of a broad range of problems.},

We simulate such flows using a higher-order Cartesian-grid method, together with a special treatment for the cells cut by the boundary of an object. A new method for the treatment of the boundary is described where these cut boundary cells are maintained as whole cells rather than as cut cells, thus avoiding stability problems. The method is second-order accurate in one dimension and higher-order accurate in two dimensions but not strictly conservative; however, we show that this error in the conservation does not lead to spurious phenomena on some representative test calculations. The advantages of the new boundary treatment are that it is higher-order accurate, that it is independent of the applied method, and that it is simple.},

Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can be treated. The current ghost cell treatment is both suitable for staggered and non-staggered Cartesian grids. The accuracy of the current method is validated using flow past a circular cylinder and large eddy simulation of turbulent flow over a wavy surface. Numerical results are compared with experimental data and boundary-fitted grid results. The method is further extended to an existing ocean model (MITGCM) to simulate geophysical flow over a three-dimensional bump. The method is easily implemented as evidenced by our use of several existing codes.},

Unlike many other higher-order slip conditions these are applicable to any form of surface geometry.

A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical.

	abstract = {The development of powerful computational tools for simulating phenomena that inhibits the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) structure has become one of the core research issues in astrophysics and is one of the compelling fields. The relativistic MHD equations are more complex than the non-relativistic ones due to non-linear relations between conserved and state (primitive) variables. The non-linearity of the systems and the flow near speed of light pose major challenges to the theoretical investigation of the models and to the numerical solution techniques. The current numerical study is related to the implementation of the space–time conservation element and solution element (CE/SE) method for solving one-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (SRMHD) equations. In contrast to the existing upwind finite volume schemes, the Riemann solver and reconstruction procedure are not the building blocks of the suggested method. The method differs from previous techniques because of global and local flux conservation in a space–time domain without resorting to interpolation or extrapolation. For validation, the numerical results of the method are compared with the second order central and kinetic flux-vector splitting schemes. The one-dimensional computations of this paper verify the method’s efficiency, robustness and accuracy which are the key parameters in the context of astrophysical scenario.},

	abstract = {Classical fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics; that is, it proceeds on the assumption that a fluid is practically continuous and homogeneous in structure. The fundamental property which distinguishes a fluid from other continuous media is that it cannot be in equilibrium in a state of stress such that the mutual action between two adjacent parts is oblique to the common surface. Though this property is the basis of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, it is by itself insufficient for the description of fluid motion. In order to characterize the physical behavior of a fluid the property must be extended, given suitable analytical form, and introduced into the equations of motion of a general continuous medium, this leading ultimately to a system of differential equations which are to be satisfied by the, velocity, density, pressure, etc. of an arbitrary fluid motion. In this article we shall consider these differential equations, their derivation from fundamental axioms, and the various forms which they take when more or less special assumptions concerning the fluid or the fluid motion are made.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions, respectively. Using the velocity2013stress formulation provides a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids and viscous fluids. The proposed method relies on the finite volume (FV) approach where cell-averaged quantities are evolved in time by computing numerical fluxes at the element interfaces. The basic ingredient of the numerical flux function is the solution of Generalized Riemann Problems at the element interfaces according to the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) approach of  Toro et al., where the initial data is piecewise polynomial instead of piecewise constant as it was in the original first-order FV scheme developed by Godunov. The ADER approach automatically produces a scheme of uniformly high order of accuracy in space and time. The high-order polynomials in space, needed as input for the numerical flux function, are obtained using a reconstruction operator acting on the cell averages. This reconstruction operator uses some techniques originally developed in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element framework, namely hierarchical orthogonal basis functions in a reference element. In particular, in this article we pay special attention to underline the differences as well as the points in common with the ADER-DG schemes previously developed by the authors, especially concerning the MPI parallelization of both methods. The numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the proposed FV schemes provide very high order of accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher order reconstructions. Applications to a series of well-acknowledged elastic and anelastic test cases and comparisons with analytic and numerical reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER-FV approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.},

This results, on the one hand in a very strong directional dependent sound velocity and on the other hand, in a low wave velocity in certain directions, resulting in a high figure of merit for the acousto-optical interaction. In the case of inhomogeneous waves, the slowness surfaces change their shape and magnitude, for all crystals. However, for paratellurite, this effect is again extraordinary. As soon as a relatively small inhomogeneity is considered, the sound velocity for the QSH mode becomes really exceptionally anisotropic, resulting in a slowness surface that is almost spherical, covered by pins. The velocity corresponding to those [`]pins', is much lower than in the case of homogeneous plane waves, which is very promising for the future development of acousto-optic cells involving an even higher figure of merit.},

	abstract = {The second coefficient of viscosity is concerned with the viscous forces generated by compression (or dilatation). In the absence of knowledge of its magnitude in liquids it has been customary in hydrodynamics to assume that the coefficient of dilatational viscosity, n′, could be approximated by the ideal gas value n′=-2n/3, where n is the coefficient of shear viscosity. A method has been developed for obtaining values for the dilatational viscosity which is based on Eckart's theory of acoustical streaming; the non-periodic motion of the fluid in the vicinity of a sound source is dependent on the two coefficients of viscosity. Values for the coefficient of dilatational viscosity for a variety of organic liquids and for water are given in the table. The coefficient of dilatational viscosity was found to be positive in sign and greater in magnitude than the shear viscosity. For example, the dilatational viscosity of water was found to be 2.4 centipoise and that for carbon disulfide greater than 200 centipoise. There is no correlation between the magnitude of the shear and dilatational viscosities for the liquids studied. Temperature variation measurements on water show that the temperature dependence of dilatational and shear viscosity in this substance is identical. Introduction of values for the dilatational viscosity into acoustical calculations eliminates the well-known discrepancy between theory and observation of sound absorption in liquids at very high frequencies.},

The definition of bulk modulus is used to relate density with pressure. For 3D flow fields, there are four equations with density and velocity components as the unknowns. The inviscid equations are proved to be hyperbolic because an arbitrary linear combination of the three Jacobian matrices is diagonalizable and has a real spectrum. The left and right eigenvector matrices are explicitly derived. Moreover, an analytical form of the Riemann invariants are derived. The model equations are indeed suitable for modeling wave propagation in low-speed, nearly incompressible air and water flows. To demonstrate the capability of the new formulation, we use the CESE method to solve the 2D equations for aeolian tones generated by air flows passing a circular cylinder at Re = 89,000, 46,000, and 22,000. Numerical results compare well with previously published data.

Based on measured wave absorption coefficients, the viscoelasticity models in the time domain are determined. Results show that Fung’s model does not support the frequency-dependent damping effect, but Iatridis’ model does. To validate the approach, numerical simulation of propagating wavelets in a skeletal pig muscle is performed. The constructed relaxation function is discretized by parallelly connected Standard Linear Solid (SLS) models. The hereditary integration is then transformed into a set of partial differential equations by introducing the internal variables. Together, the governing equations include the equation of motion, the constitutive equation, and the equations of internal variables.

	abstract = {An extension is made to Lighthill's general theory of aerodynamic sound, so as to incorporate the influence of solid boundaries upon the sound field. This influence is twofold, namely (i) reflexion and diffraction of the sound waves at the solid boundaries, and (ii) a resultant dipole field at the solid boundaries which are the limits of Lighthill's quadrupole distribution. It is shown that these effects are exactly equivalent to a distribution of dipoles, each representing the force with which unit area of solid boundary acts upon the fluid. A dimensional analysis shows that the intensity of the sound generated by the dipoles should at large distances x be of the general form I\${\textbackslash}propto \$ \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{0\}\$ U\$\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$a\$\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ L\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$x\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, where U\$\_\{0\}\$ is a typical velocity of the flow, L is a typical length of the body, a\$\_\{0\}\$ is the velocity of sound in fluid at rest and \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{0\}\$ is the density of the fluid at rest. Accordingly, these dipoles should be more efficient generators of sound than the quadrupoles of Lighthill's theory if the Mach number is small enough. It is shown that the fundamental frequency of the dipole sound is one half of the frequency of the quadrupole sound.},

	abstract = {A theory is initiated, based on the equations of motion of a gas, for the purpose of estimating the sound radiated from a fluid flow, with rigid boundaries, which as a result of instability contains regular fluctuations or turbulence. The sound field is that which would be produced by a static distribution of acoustic quadrupoles whose instantaneous strength per unit volume is \${\textbackslash}rho \$v\$\_\{i\}\$v\$\_\{j\}\$ + p\$\_\{ij\}\$ - a\$\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}delta \_\{ij\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}rho \$ is the density, v\$\_\{i\}\$ the velocity vector, p\$\_\{ij\}\$ the compressive stress tensor, and a\$\_\{0\}\$ the velocity of sound outside the flow. This quadrupole strength density may be approximated in many cases as \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{0\}\$v\$\_\{i\}\$v\$\_\{i\}\$. The radiation field is deduced by means of retarded potential solutions. In it, the intensity depends crucially on the frequency as well as on the strength of the quadrupoles, and as a result increases in proportion to a high power, near the eighth, of a typical velocity U in the flow. Physically, the mechanism of conversion of energy from kinetic to acoustic is based on fluctuations in the flow of momentum across fixed surfaces, and it is explained in section 2 how this accounts both for the relative inefficiency of the process and for the increase of efficiency with U. It is shown in section 7 how the efficiency is also increased, particularly for the sound emitted forwards, in the case of fluctuations convected at a not negligible Mach number.},

The computational methods currently used in physics are based on the discretization of differential equations. This is because the computer can only perform algebraic operations. The purpose of this paper is to critically review this practice, showing how to obtain a purely algebraic formulation of physical laws starting directly from experimental measurements. In other words, we can get an algebraic formulation avoiding any arbitrary process of discretization of differential equations. This formulation has the great merit of maintaining close contact between the mathematical description and the physical phenomenon described.},

A family of compressible multi-phase fluid and fluid-structure interaction problems for which implicit schemes are preferrable over explicit counterparts is identified. Using as a backdrop a finite volume method based on exact two-phase Riemann problems that has proven to be robust for multi-phase flows with strong contact discontinuities and highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problems, an implicit computational framework for the solution of such problems is presented. General issues that arise in the context of second- and higher-order time-discretizations of multi-material problems by multi-step schemes are highlighted, and solutions to these issues are presented in the form of redesigned implicit time-integrators. The proposed implicit computational framework is illustrated with the solution of an air-water shock tube problem, a realistic compressible multi-phase fluid problem, and a highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem associated with the underwater implosion of a cylindrical shell. In all cases, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed implicit computational framework are demonstrated, and its superior computational performance is highlighted.},

The velocity-stress equations are useful for numerical solution. The original equations include the equation of motion and the elasticity relation differentiated by time. The result is a set of nine, first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) of which the velocity and stress components are the unknowns. Cast into a vector-matrix form, the equations can be characterized by three Jacobian matrices. Hyperbolicity of the equations is formally proved by analyzing (i) the spectrum of a linear combination of the three Jacobian matrices, and (ii) the eigenvector matrix for diagonalizing the linearly combined Jacobian matrices. In the three-dimensional space, linearly combined Jacobian matrices are shown to be connected to the classic Christoffel matrix, leading to a simpler derivation for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The results in the present paper provide critical information for applying modern numerical methods, originally developed for solving conservation laws, to elastodynamics.},

Furthermore, hybridization is used to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom. For the scalar case, a local postprocessing procedure is used to enhance the quality of the approximate solution w h . The method reduces to a DG scheme for pure convection, and to a Mixed method for pure diffusion, while for the intermediate case the combined variational formulation requires no additional parameters.

There are two leading DPL technologies: self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE). Among these two DPL technologies, SADP has the significant advantage over LELE in its ability to avoid overlay, making it the likely DPL candidate for the next technology node of 14nm. In any DPL technology, layout decomposition is the key problem. While the layout decomposition problem for LELE has been well-studied in the literature, only few attempts have been made to address the SADP layout decomposition problem. In this paper, we present the first polynomial time exact (optimal) algorithm to determine if a given layout has an overlay-free SADP decomposition. All previous exact algorithms were computationally expensive exponential time algorithms based on SAT or ILP. Other previous algorithms for the problem were heuristics without having any guarantee that an overlay-free solution can be found even if one exists.},

	abstract = {As the semiconductor industry marches towards 22 nm technology and beyond, circuit design has become unprecedentedly omplicated. This presents many new challenges for EDA (electronic design automation), such as lack of effective tools for analog circuit or high-volume and high-frequency printed circuit board (PCB) design, the contradiction between complex EDA compute workloads and
time-to-market pressure,  manufacturing variability and power
management, to name but a few. In this dissertation, we will propose
several new strategies to handle the challenges in the EDA field.

Wire routing is an important step in the design of PCBs. Although
there are many industrial tools to handle IC routing problems, very
few tools can handle the routing on high-density and high-frequency
boards effectively. Nowadays, most of the PCB routing is still done
by tedious and time-consuming manual work. We provide new strategies to solve an important problem in PCB routing, the escape routing problem. Our first strategy is to use Boolean satisfiability to optimally solve the escape routing problem on one PCB component. Our second strategy is to use a novel boundary routing methodology to finish escape routing from two connected PCB components simultaneously. This router can achieve much better routability than industrial tools with less CPU time.

Another challenge seen in the EDA field is the increasing CPU time
to handle larger and larger designs. On the other hand, many
fundamental algorithms and data structures used in the EDA tools
have shown great parallelism, such as the well-known BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm and the R-tree structure. Therefore, we propose strategies to use the cost-effective GPU platform to parallelize and accelerate BFS and R-tree query. These strategies are potentially applicable to many EDA problems.},

	title = {Direct numerical simulations and modeling of jets in crossflow},
	abstract = {Jets in crossflow are central to a variety of applications such as fuel injection, gas turbine combustion and film-cooling. Direct Numerical Simulations are used to study the different aspects of round jets in a crossflow. The first problem studies the effect of jet and crossflow velocity profiles on jet trajectories and the near-field. A new scaling law for the jet trajectory is proposed, that accounts for these parameters. The proposed scaling is shown to be a significant improvement over current scaling laws. DNS of a turbulent jet in crossflow is performed at conditions corresponding to an experiment (Su \& Mungal 2004). Detailed comparison shows good agreement with experiment, and additional quantities, not available experimentally, are presented. Turbulent kinetic energy budget is computed, and is used to suggest possible reasons for the difficulty experienced by current engineering models in predicting this complex flow. A predictor-corrector approach is implemented to compute passive scalar transport. This ensures that the local scalar concentration is always within bounds. The passive scalar is introduced along with the jet fluid, once the velocity field is statistically stationary. Mean scalar profiles show a good agreement when compared to the experiment. The scalar field is used to compute entrainment of the crossflow fluid by the jet, which is greater than that in a regular jet. The reasons for a transverse jet's enhanced entrainment are explained in terms of the pressure field in the vicinity of the jet. A two-dimensional model problem is used to study jet cross-section deformation. The model jet deforms at its trailing edge, exhibits the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at its outer edges, and---later---yields a counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP). The model jet experiences constant acceleration in its initial stages, and moves at constant velocity at longer times. Deformation of the jet cross-section may be explained in terms of the pressure field that the crossflow fluid imposes on the jet, and the acceleration that the jet experiences. It is shown that the CVP is formed even in two dimensions, and that the pipe is not necessary.},

The physics is represented via simple modules containing PDE-dependent parameters as well as hierarchic higher-order finite elements satisfying the conformity requirements imposed by the PDE. After describing briefly the modular structure of HERMES and some of its functionality, we focus on its application to the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations.

Contrary to many finite-element implementations, ours is implemented successfully in single precision, maximizing the performance of current generation GPUs. We discuss the implementation and optimization of the code and compare it to an existing very optimized implementation in C language and MPI on a classical cluster of CPU nodes. We use mesh coloring to efficiently handle summation operations over degrees of freedom on an unstructured mesh, and non-blocking MPI messages in order to overlap the communications across the network and the data transfer to and from the device via PCIe with calculations on the GPU. We perform a number of numerical tests to validate the single-precision CUDA and MPI implementation and assess its accuracy.

These platforms have complex memory hierarchies that include local core-based cache, local socket-based memory, access to memory on the same mainboard from another socket, and then memory across network links to different nodes. The specific semiconductor device simulator used in this study employs a fully-coupled Newton-Krylov solver with domain decomposition and multilevel preconditioners. Scaling results presented include a large-scale problem of 100+ million unknowns on 4096 cores and a comparison with the Cray XT3/4 Red Storm capability platform. Although the MPI-only device simulator employed for this work can take advantage of all the cores of quad-core and six-core CPUs, the efficiency of the linear system solve is decreasing with increased core count and eventually a different programming paradigm will be needed.},

simulation packages on the newly installed NASA Columbia supercomputer. These
packages include both a high-fidelity, unstructured, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
solver, and a fully-automated inviscid flow package for cut-cell Cartesian grids.
The complementary combination of these two simulation codes enables high-fidelity
characterization of aerospace vehicle design performance over the entire flight
envelope through extensive parametric analysis and detailed simulation of critical
regions of the flight envelope. Both packages are industrial-level codes designed
for complex geometry and incorporate customized multigrid solution algorithms. The
performance of these codes on Columbia is examined using both MPI and OpenMP and
using both the NUMAlink and InfiniBand interconnect fabrics. Numerical results
demonstrate good scalability on up to 2016 CPUs using the NUMAlink4 interconnect,
with measured computational rates in the vicinity of 3 TFLOP/s, while InfiniBand
showed some performance degradation at high CPU counts, particularly with multigrid.
Nonetheless, the results are encouraging enough to indicate that larger test cases
using combined MPI/OpenMP communication should scale well on even more processors.},

	abstract = {Designs for conventional ducted wind turbines usually include a large inlet for more absorption of the airflow. However, the most efficient solution should be increasing the speed of wind. In this paper, a bucket-shape ducted wind turbine is proposed and studies show that a sucking effect can be produced according to the Bernoulli's principle, and this significantly increases the wind speed inside the duct and substantially enhances the efficiency of the wind turbine. Moreover, the geometry of the duct is optimized by the combination of an improved complex algorithm, an object-oriented optimizing program interface, and simulations by CFD software. According to the analyses, the optimal shape for the interior of the duct appears to be an unconventional nozzle, which extends the range of wind speed by 60\%.
Based on this bucket duct equipped with the optimal nozzle, we have practically designed and constructed a wind power generator. The results of the field tests show that the proposed ducted turbine does improve the flow around the generator and thus increase its power extraction efficiency by about 80\%.},

Although the first offshore wind farm experiment took place in 1990, most of the facilities built up to now have been pilot projects. Then, offshore wind power can be considered as an incipient market. However, just at this moment, the growth of this technology finally seems to be happening, being several countries at the top of its development (the United Kingdom, Denmark, Holland, Sweden and Germany). This current situation, the raw materials problems and the general commitments to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases are leading to predict a promising future for this technology. This paper deals with a brief revision of the state of the art of offshore wind power, followed by a critical discussion about the causes of the recently growth that is currently happening. The discussion is based on the comparison of offshore wind energy with other renewable energies (like onshore wind, marine hydrodynamics, hydraulic, solar, etc.) and even with conventional power.},

	abstract = {With the current shift of increasing the computational power of a processor by including multiple cores instead of increasing the clock frequency, consideration of computational efficiency is gaining increased importance for computational fluid dynamics codes. This is especially critical for applications that require high throughput. For example, applying computational fluid dynamics simulations to multi-disciplinary design optimization requires a large number of similar simulations with different input parameters. Therefore, a reduction in the runtime of the code can lead to large reduction in the design process. In our case study, a two-dimensional, block-structured computational fluid dynamics code was optimized for performance on machines with hierarchical memory systems. This paper illustrates the techniques applied to transform an initial version of the code to an optimized version that yielded performance improvements of 10\% for very small cases to about 50\% for large test cases that did not fit into the cache memory of the target processor. A detailed performance analysis of the code starting at the global level down to subroutines and data structures is presented in this paper. The performance improvements can be explained through a reduction of cache misses in all levels of the memory hierarchy. The L1 cache misses were reduced by about 50\%, the L2 cache misses by about 80\% and the translation lookaside buffer misses by about 90\% for the optimized version of the code. The code performance was also evaluated for multi-core processors, where efficiency is especially important when several instances of an application are running simultaneously. In this case, the most optimized version, a blocked version of the optimized code, more effectively maintained efficiency as more cores were activated compared to the unblocked version. This illustrates that optimizing cache performance may be increasingly important as the number of cores per processor continues to rise.},

An axisymmetric framework is established, based on an improved CE/SE scheme, to solve the high-velocity impact problems with large deformations, high strain rates and spall fractures. The hybrid particle level set method is adopted for tracking material interfaces and describing the formation and propagation of a crack. A novel representation of crack by level set is proposed. Numerical simulations are carried out and compared to the corresponding experimental results. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The edge effects are reproduced and the decrease of scab thickness with increase in impact velocity is observed owing to the numerical analysis. It is proved that our computational technique is feasible and reliable for analyzing the spall fracture.},

The intended application is to study aspects of ultrasound imaging of soft biological tissue.The forward wave propagation is modelled by a one-way wave equation. The equation describes tissue exhibiting nonlinear elasticity and arbitrary frequency-dependent attenuation.A numerical solution to the equation is found by means of first-order accurate operator splitting and propagation along the spatial depth coordinate. Thus diffraction, nonlinearity and attenuation are solved independently at each propagation step, rendering their relative importance easy to monitor.The method is seen to yield an accurate simulation of the wave propagation when compared to numerical solutions of the full wave equation and experiments in a water tank.By this approach it is possible to simulate wave propagation over relatively large distances—typically several hundred wavelengths—at a modest computational complexity compared to solution of the full wave equation. It furthermore facilitates a high degree of parallelism, thus enabling efficient distribution of the required computations overmultiple processors.},

	abstract = {Linear viscoelasticity offers a minimal framework within which to construct a causal model for wave propagation in absorptive media. Viscoelastic media are often described as media with 'fading memory,' that is, the present state of stress is dependent on the present strain and the complete time history of strain convolved with appropriate time-dependent shear and bulk stress relaxation moduli. An axisymmetric, displacement-based finite element method for modeling pulsed ultrasonic waves in linear, homogeneous, and isotropic (LHI) viscoelastic media is developed that does not require storage of the complete time history of displacement at every node. This is accomplished by modeling stress relaxation moduli as discrete or continuous spectra of decaying exponentials and relaxation times. Details of the construction and computation of the time-dependent stiffness matrix are presented. As an application of the finite element method, a finite number of exponentials (amplitudes and relaxation times) are employed to represent a typical model for a continuous relaxation spectrum. It is demonstrated that a small number of discrete exponentials are required to model ultrasonic wave propagation of a typical band-limited pulse in a model material accurately. Previous work has shown this model to be consistent with other analytic models for wave propagation in viscoelastic media [1].},

	abstract = {A finite-difference time-domain model for ultrasonic pulse propagation through soft tissue has been extended to incorporate absorption effects as well as longitudinal-wave propagation in cartilage and bone. This extended model has been used to simulate ultrasonic propagation through anatomically detailed representations of chest wall structure. The inhomogeneous chest wall tissue is represented by two-dimensional maps determined by staining chest wall cross sections to distinguish between tissue types, digitally scanning the stained cross sections, and mapping each pixel of the scanned images to fat, muscle, connective tissue, cartilage, or bone. Each pixel of the tissue map is then assigned a sound speed, density, and absorption value determined from published measurements and assumed to be representative of the local tissue type. Computational results for energy level fluctuations and arrival time fluctuations show qualitative agreement with measurements performed on the same specimens, but show significantly less waveform distortion than measurements. Visualization of simulated tissue-ultrasound interactions in the chest wall shows possible mechanisms for image aberration in echocardiography, including effects associated with reflection and diffraction caused by rib structures. A comparison of distortion effects for varying pulse center frequencies shows that, for soft tissue paths through the chest wall, energy level and waveform distortion increase markedly with rising ultrasonic frequency and that arrival-time fluctuations increase to a lesser degree.},

The elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle serves as a tool to obtain as well analytical and numerical BEM and FEM solutions of wave propagation and vibration problems by transform methods. Characteristics of viscoelastic waves and vibrations are discussed. The paper focusses on material damping but includes aspects of radiation damping description by discretisation methods as well. Important aspects of damping description are beyond the scope of selected topics of this survey paper.

	abstract = {The anisotropic linear viscoelastic rheological relation constitutes a suitable model for describing the variety of phenomena which occur in seismic wavefields. This rheology, known also as Boltzmann's superposition principle, expresses the stress as a time convolution of a fourth rank tensorial relaxation function with the strain tensor. The first problem is to establish the time dependence of the relaxation tensor in a general and consistent way. Two kernels based on the general standard linear solid are identified with the mean stress and with the deviatoric components of the stress tensor in a given coordinate system, respectively. Additional conditions are that in the elastic limit the relaxation matrix must give the elasticity matrix, and in the isotropic limit the relaxation matrix must approach the isotropic-viscoelastic matrix. The resulting rheological relation provides the framework for incorporating anelasticity in time-marching methods for computing synthetic seismograms. Through a plane wave analysis of the anisotropic-viscoelastic medium, the phase, group and energy velocities are calculated in function of the complex velocity, showing that those velocities are in general different from each other. For instance, the energy velocity which represents the wave surface, is different from the group velocity unlike in the anisotropic-elastic case. The group velocity loses its physical meaning at the cusps where singularities appear. Each frequency component of the wavefield has a different non-spherical wavefront. Moreover, the quality factors for the different propagating modes are not isotropic. Examples of these physical quantities are shown for transversely isotropic-viscoelastic clayshale and sandstone. As in the isotropic-viscoelastic case, Boltzmann's superposition principle is implemented in the equation of motion by defining memory variables which circumvent the convolutional relation between stress and strain. The numerical problem is solved by using a new time integration technique specially designed to deal with wave propagation in linear viscoelastic media. As a first application snapshots and synthetic seismograms are computed for 2-D transversely isotropic-viscoelastic clayshale and sandstone which show substantial differences in amplitude, waveform and arrival time with the results given by the isotropic and elastic rheologies.},

Applications extend to both problems on a scale of interest to engineers and also to large-scale seismological problems. Solutions are sought in the time domain. Efficient programs have been written to accomplish this. The scope of numerical solutions has been greatly enhanced by the use of a previously reported scheme for exactly cancelling reflections at the boundaries of the model. The finite difference results of Boore and the analytical results of Trifunac for the amplification due to a mountain and an alluvial valley respectively are compared with new finite element results. The new results agree well, although there are some difficulties with resonance in the alluvial valley problem. Boore's SH results have been extended to vertical P and SV incidence. A deep earthquake zone has been modelled realistically in two dimensions and earthquakes simulated at depth. It is suggested that the variation in observed amplitude across the top of the zone, due to refraction away from the slab, may be used to provide an estimate of the thickness of the slab from long-period observations of local earthquakes.},

One case of particular interest concerns the examination of particle displacement and velocity at the surface in a circular area above the source. In another application seismograms generated by an explosive buried source are contrasted with seismograms generated by the transient application of a vertically directed load to the free surface. Still another application of considerable practical interest concerns the study of the nongeometrical pS2014wave, in particular its characteristics as functions of range and depth. Finally, in the last application the behavior of a rarely observed wave (denoted here by the letter U) is studied in both elastic and visco-elastic half-spaces.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic anisotropic wave equation with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the most general Hooke's tensor we derive the velocity-stress formulation leading to a linear hyperbolic system which accounts for the variation of the material properties depending on direction. This approach allows for the accurate modelling even of the most general crystalline symmetry class, the triclinic anisotropy, as no interpolation of material properties to particular mesh vertices is necessary. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin method with the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration approach using arbitrary high-order derivatives of the piecewise polynomial representation of the unknown solution. The discontinuities of this piecewise polynomial approximation at element interfaces permit the application of the well-established theory of finite volumes and numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of derivative Riemann problems. Due to the novel ADER time integration technique the scheme provides the same approximation order in space and time automatically. A numerical convergence study confirms that the new scheme achieves the desired arbitrary high-order accuracy even for anisotropic material on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Furthermore, it shows that higher accuracy can be reached with higher-order schemes while reducing computational cost and storage space. To this end, we also present a new Godunov-type numerical flux for anisotropic material and compare its accuracy with a computationally simpler Rusanov flux. As a further extension, we include the coupling of anisotropy and viscoelastic attenuation based on the Generalized Maxwell Body rheology and the mean and deviatoric stress concepts. Finally, we validate the new scheme by comparing the results of our simulations to an analytic solution as well as to spectral element computations.},

	abstract = {This article describes the extension of the arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (ADER-DG) method to treat locally varying polynomial degress of the basis functions, so-called p-adaptivity, as well as locally varying time steps that may be different from one element to another. The p-adaptive version of the scheme is useful in complex 3-D models with small-scale features which have to be meshed with reasonably small elements to capture the necessary geometrical details of interest. Using a constant high polynomial degree of the basis functions in the whole computational domain can lead to an unreasonably high CPU effort since good spatial resolution at the surface may be already obtained by the fine mesh. Therefore, it can be more adequate in some cases to use a lower order method in the small elements to reduce the CPU effort without loosing much accuracy. To further increase computational efficiency, we present a new local time stepping (LTS) algorithm. For usual explicit time stepping schemes the element with the smallest time step resulting from the stability criterion of the method will dictate its time step to all the other elements of the computational domain. In contrast, by using local time stepping, each element can use its optimal time step given by the local stability condition. Our proposed LTS algorithm for ADER-DG is very general and does not need any temporal synchronization between the elements. Due to the ADER approach, accurate time interpolation is automatically provided at the element interfaces such that the computational overhead is very small and such that the method maintains the uniform high order of accuracy in space and time as in the usual ADER-DG schemes with a globally constant time step. However, the LTS ADER-DG method is computationally much more efficient for problems with strongly varying element size or material parameters since it allows to reduce the total number of element updates considerably. This holds especially for unstructured tetrahedral meshes that contain strongly degenerate elements, so-called slivers. We show numerical convergence results and CPU times for LTS ADER-DG schemes up to sixth order in space and time on irregular tetrahedral meshes containing elements of very different size and also on tetrahedral meshes containing slivers. Further validation of the algorithm is provided by results obtained for the layer over half-space (LOH.1) benchmark problem proposed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center.

	abstract = {We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER2013DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

	abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a computational accelerator that dramatically reduces the time to discovery in high-end computing (HEC). However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a “non-green” computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a “power-hungry GPU” via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore.},

The new kernel performs the requisite 3-D DFTs as ensembles of 1-D transforms, and by doing so, is able to reduce the number of constituent 1-D transforms by 60\% and the memory by over 80\%. The optimizations also facilitate the use of parallel techniques to further enhance the performance.

The mathematical model, based on conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum, and a hypoelastic constitutive equation, consists of a set of three first-order, fully-coupled, nonlinear, hyperbolic partial differential equations. Three forms of the model equations are presented: the conservative form, the non-conservative form, and the diagonal form. The conservative form is solved numerically using the Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method, a highly-accurate explicit space-time finite-volume scheme for solving nonlinear hyperbolic systems. To demonstrate this numerical approach, two elastic wave problems are directly calculated: (i) resonant standing waves arising from a time-harmonic external axial load and (ii) propagating compression waves arising from a bi-material collinear impact. Simulations of the resonance problem illustrate a linear-to-nonlinear evolution of the resonant vibrations, the emergence of super-harmonics of the forcing frequency, and the distribution of wave energy among multiple modes. For the bi-material impact problem, the CESE method successfully captures the sharp traveling wavefronts, wave reflection and transmission, and the different wave propagation speeds in each material.},

These effects in a Y-Z lithium niobate filter are analyzed using a recently developed finite element model. In this model, the equations of wave propagation in piezoelectric materials are discretized using the Galerkin method, in which an implicit algorithm of the Newmark family with unconditional stability is implemented. The Rayleigh damping coefficients are included in the elements near the boundary to reduce the interference of reflected waves. The frequency response of the filter is obtained through the Fourier transform of the impulse response, which is solved directly from the finite element simulation. The analyses have shown that for aluminum electrodes of fixed thickness, the second order effects on the frequency response become increasingly significant as the device is scaled smaller to have higher central frequencies. Typically, for aluminum electrodes of thickness 2000 A, the frequency response is significantly distorted for the device of the central frequency at above 2 GHz. Quantitative analyses of the second order effects in the device of various center frequencies provide insights for designing high performance SAW devices for high frequency applications.},

	abstract = {This work presents a new constitutive law for linear viscoelastic and anisotropic media, to model rock behaviour and its effects on wave propagation. In areas with high dissipation properties (e.g. hydrocarbon reservoirs), the interpretation of seismic data based on the isotropic and purely elastic assumption might lead to misinterpretations or, even worse, to overlooking useful information. Thus, a proper description of wave propagation requires a rheology which accounts for the anisotropic and anelastic behaviour of rocks. the present model is based on the following mechanical interpretation; each eigenvector (eigenstrain) of the stiffness tensor of an anisotropic solid defines a fundamental deformation state of the medium. the six eigenvalues (eigenstiffnesses) represent the genuine elastic parameters. Since they are independent of the reference system, they have an intrinsic physical content. From this fact and the correspondence principle we infer that in a real medium the rheological properties depend essentially on six relaxation functions, which are the generalization of the eigenstiffnesses to the viscoeiastic case. the existence of six or less complex moduli depends on the symmetry class of the medium. We probe the new stress-strain relation with homogeneous viscoelastic plane waves, and give expressions for the slowness, attenuation, phase velocity, energy velocity (wavefront) and quality factor of the different wave modes.},

	abstract = {Geological causes of crustal anisotropy include regional fractures and cracks, isotropic heterogeneity or layering and material composition and textural properties. In addition, shear or metamorphic foliations in fault zones or structural terranes can serve as proxies for intracrustal deformation in a manner analogous to the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine produced by mantle shear. The primary factor in the production of crustal anisotropy is the relative angle between a seismic wave and the (dipping) symmetry axes of crustal material as either change along the propagation ray path. Complex and heterogeneous, crustal material is not necessarily oriented with vertical/horizontal symmetry axes, but is more normally tilted in accordance with structure. Calculation of the anisotropic response to material tilt for elastic seismic wave propagation requires rotation of the stiffness tensors describing the crustal material. We examine the alteration of anisotropic stiffness tensors and provide rotation directional cosines based on geological measurements. Material tilt produces strong effects in examples of 2-D and 3-D finite-difference synthetic seismograms that might otherwise be attributed to velocities or structure in other regions of the crust or mantle.},

	abstract = {We present the spectral element method to simulate elastic-wave propagation in realistic geological structures involving complieated free-surface topography and material interfaces for two- and three-dimensional geometries. The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construction in this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions. The associated Courant condition behaves as \{Delta\}tC {\textless} O (nel-1/ndN-2), with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solutions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin. The flexibility of the method is then illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models involving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time visualization and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seismic risk assessment.},

The [alpha] phase crystal (0-940 K) has orthorhombic symmetry, which is unique among unalloyed metals, and, because of its dimensional instability as a fuel element in early nuclear reactors, has a nearly unique history as a subject for solid state research. The need to understand its behavior under neutron irradiation sparked a world-wide effort to investigate the anisotropic properties of the crystal and its polycrystalline aggregates. Methods for metal purification and for preparing single crystals were followed by very precise measurements of mechanical and physical properties in general. The unusual scope of the research was enhanced by the discovery of a second-order phase transition at 43 K and speculations regarding magnetic structures and superconductivity of uranium and the other 5f elements. In this review some of the early research beginning in 1948 and the low temperature and high pressure research that followed up to 1978 are described. This precedes the surprising discovery of the charge-density-wave structures that emerged from the lattice dynamic studies and neutron elastic scattering in 1979 and 1980.},

Velocities of surface acoustic waves (both Rayleigh and pseudo-surface waves) were measured using impulsively stimulated light scattering on polished surfaces having six different orientations (three normal to the Cartesian axes and three lying on diagonals). Data were inverted and results tested using several non-linear optimization techniques. Compliance moduli determined under hydrostatic compression provided additional constraints and reduced covariance in the reported constants. The Cartesian coordinate system associated with the constants (using the \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\}{\textbackslash}ifmmode{\textbackslash}expandafter{\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}else{\textbackslash}expandafter{\textbackslash}={\textbackslash}fi\{1\} \$\$ unit cell) has the y-axis parallel to the crystal b axis, the x-axis parallel to a* (perpendicular to b and c) and the z-axis consistent with a right-handed coordinate system.

characterized by the slowness surface and ray surface which represent
phase velocities and group velocities, respectively. The mathematical
expressions for the slowness surface in terms of elastic constants are
well established and provide a foundation for acoustic determination
of the elastic constants of anisotropic elastic media. However, a
direct mathematical formulation of the ray surface has not been fully
developed because of the many-to-one correspondence between the ray
surface and the slowness surface. Based upon the Stroh formalism for
two-dimensional elastodynamic systems, we establish in this paper a
direct and analytical formalism, the degeneracy analysis approach
(DAA), for the construction of the ray surface and the recovery of
elastic constants for anisotropic media. A special emphasis is put on
the group velocities along symmetry directions with respect to
symmetry planes, for which an explicit expression for the group
velocity is given in terms of the elastic constants so that the
inverse problem can be solved easily. Particularly, the complication
of cuspidal points due to the presence of axial concavity in the
slowness surface is treated and it is apparent that the presence of a
cuspidal point becomes an advantage for the inverse problem of
recovery of elastic constants.},

At each iterative step a numerical minimization process is employed to find the wave normals and velocities of waves having the required ray directions. The method is demonstrated with synthetic data generated for a number of cubic crystals, and to experimental data obtained on single crystals of silicon using the ultrasonic point-source/enpoint-receiver technique. When provided with longitudinal- and transverse-mode velocity data, the method is able to accurately recover all three independent elastic constants.

The focusing properties of FIDTs are dominated solely by their geometric shapes. Therefore, to obtain optimal performance, it is essential to analyze the FIDTs with a variety of geometric shapes. However, among the existing studies concerning the diffraction of FIDTs, a detailed analysis and design of FIDTs is still in paucity. In this paper, we adopted the exact angular spectrum of plane wave theory (ASoW) to calculate the amplitude fields of FIDTs on Y-Z lithium niobate (LiNbO3) with the shape as a concentric circular arc and the concentric wave surface. Based on the calculation results, we discussed the variations of the amplitude fields induced by changing number of pairs, degree of arc, and geometric focal length. In addition, the focusing properties of FIDTs on the (100)-oriented GaAs substrate were also analyzed and discussed. We also summarized the guiderules for designing a FIDT via four important factors. It is worth noting that the results of this study provide an important basis for designing various FIDTs to fit the desired applications.},

In addition, using the real parts of the shear modulus, the polymer films can be classified into three types: glassy films, glassy-rubbery films and rubbery films. Simulations of gas sorption for polymer films are performed. For glassy films, the SAW sensor response increases with increasing film thickness, whereas for glassy-rubbery and rubbery films, the relationship between the sensor sensitivity and film thickness is more complicated.

Comparisons of the simulation sensitivities of SAW vapor sensors with the experimental values reported by Edward T. Zellers and co-workers confirm the general validity of the approach.

A model with a well abstraction of parallelismleads to a higher application-development productivity. In this paper, we propose seven criteria to qualitatively evaluate parallel programming models. Our focus is on how parallelism is abstracted and presented to application developers. As a case study, we use these criteria to investigate six well-known parallel programming models in the HPC community.},

A molecular dynamics application has been parallelized using both MPI and hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming models. The performance of this application has been examined on two high-end multicore clusters using both Infiniband and Gigabit Ethernet interconnects. The hybrid model has been found to perform well on the higher-latency Gigabit Ethernet connection, but offers no performance benefit on low-latency Infiniband interconnects. The changes in performance are attributed to the differing communication profiles of the hybrid and MPI codes.},

The paper will predominantly assess the extent to which the Agile software community's use of Kuhn's theory of revolutionary scientific change, particularly in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming (XP), is justified. It will be argued that whereas Kuhn's concepts of "scientific revolutions" and "paradigm shift" can partially explain the large-scale, radical change from "traditional" software methodologies to Agile ones, Popper's critical rationalism seems better suited to the small-scale, piecemeal methodological approach of Agile methodologies. The ethical implications to software engineering of Kuhn's and Popper's theories, as well as the work of the Peopleware authors and the architect, Christopher Alexander, will be discussed. Finally, the ideas of the Frankfurt School will be used to broaden the Popper versus Kuhn debate. A critical reflection on the soundness of applying theories of scientific methodology to the practice of software engineering concludes this paper.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the loss of computational efficiency that may occur when scientific codes are written in the Python programming language instead of Fortran or C. Our test problems concern the application of a seven-point finite stencil for a three-dimensional, variable coefficient, Laplace operator. This type of computation appears in lots of codes solving partial differential equations, and the variable coefficient is a key ingredient to capture the arithmetic complexity of stencils arising in advanced multi-physics problems in heterogeneous media. Different implementations of the stencil operation are described: pure Python loops over Python arrays, Psyco-acceleration of pure Python loops, vectorized loops (via shifted slice expressions), inline C++ code (via Weave), and migration of stencil loops to Fortran 77 (via F2py) and C. The performance of these implementations are compared against codes written entirely in Fortran 77 and C. We observe that decent performance is obtained with vectorization or migration of loops to compiled code. Vectorized loops run between two and five times slower than the pure Fortran and C codes. Mixed-language implementations, Python-Fortran and Python-C, where only the loops are implemented in Fortran or C, run at the same speed as the pure Fortran and C codes. At present, there are three alternative (and to some extent competing) implementations of Numerical Python: numpy, numarray, and Numeric. Our tests uncover significant performance differences between these three alternatives. Numeric is fastest on scalar operations with array indexing, while numpy is fastest on vectorized operations with array slices. We also present parallel versions of the stencil operations, where the loops are migrated to C for efficiency, and where the message passing statements are written in Python, using the high-level pypar interface to MPI. For the current test problems, there are hardly any efficiency loss by doing the message passing in Python. Moreover, adopting the Python interface of MPI gives a more elegant parallel implementation, both due to a simpler syntax of MPI calls and due to the efficient array slicing functionality that comes with Numerical Python.},

A key issue in the discussion is to hide the storage structure of the sparse matrix in application code. The role of different languages, such as Fortran, C, C++, and Python, is an integral part of the discussion. Finally, we present performance measures of the various designs and implementations.

The interaction of acoustic waves and thermoviscous fluids is responsible for these phenomena. The resonator's walls are maintained at isothermal condition. Synchronized particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique has been used to measure the streaming velocity fields. The experimental results show that at a given excitation frequency, regular streaming flow patterns are observed up to a certain value of the excitation amplitude. As the amplitude increases beyond this limit, the regular streaming is distorted to an irregular flow structure. The regular and irregular streaming are classified in terms of streaming Reynolds number . It is found that for Res2{\textless}50, classical streaming flow patterns are established and then deform to irregular and complex shapes as Res2 exceeds 50.},

Software design for finite difference schemes based on index notation. Future Generation Comput Syst 2006;22:102-9], an object-oriented PDE solver framework for finite difference methods on structured grids, using tensor abstractions for convenient representation of numerical operators. Here, the design of tengo is extended to address curvilinear coordinates. These extensions to the tengo object model are the result of applying object-oriented analysis and design combined with feature modeling. The framework was implemented in Fortran 90/95, using standard techniques for emulating object-oriented constructs in that language. The new parts of the framework were assessed with respect to programming effort and execution time. It is shown that the programming effort required for construction and modification of PDE solvers on curvilinear grids is significantly reduced through the introduction of the new framework components. Moreover, for the test case of an underwater acoustics computation, there was no significant difference in execution time between the framework based code and a special purpose Fortran 90 code for the same application.},

Belytschko, A bridging domain method for coupling continua with molecular dynamics, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 193 (2004) 1645-1669] and the Lattice Geometrical Method (LGM) [J.

These methods are implemented within a single object-oriented framework in C++ using OOP design patterns. The bulk of the original work consisted mainly of finding common objects which will work for these different modeling methods without changing a single line of the C++ code. With this approach it is possible to add new numerical models by only plugging-in the corresponding formulas. The advantages of the resulting YADE framework are the following: (1) generic design provides great flexibility when adding new scientific simulation code, (2) numerous simulation methods can be coupled within the same framework like for example DEM/FEM and (3) with the open-source philosophy, the community of users collaborate and improve the software. The YADE framework is a new emerging software, which can be downloaded at the http://yade.wikia.com webpage.},

To avoid the increase of numerical errors caused by suppressing the information contained in Gauss' law as well as the divergence-free condition of the magnetic induction, a divergence cleaning step is added which does not require the solution of a Poisson equation. The elliptical constraints of the Maxwell equations is approximated by a hyperbolic condition, starting from the so-called Generalized Lagrange Multiplier Maxwell model. This results in a purely hyperbolic system that fits very well in the framework of high-resolution finite-volume schemes yielding an efficient and flexible parallel Maxwell solver for explicit field calculations in time domain on unstructured grids in three space dimensions. Simulation results obtained with this new approximation technique are presented and compared with analytical as well as with other methods.},

	abstract = {The article presents the software architecture and implementation of the problem-solving environment (PSE) PELLPACK for modeling physical objects described by partial differential equations (PDEs). The scope of this PSE is broad, as PELLPACK incorporates many PDE solving systems, and some of these, in turn, include several specific PDE solving methods. Its coverage for 1D, 2D. and 3D elliptic or parabolic problems is quite broad, and it handles some hyperbolic problems, Since a PSE should provided complete support for the problem-solving process, PELLPACK also contains a large amount of code to support graphical user interfaces, analystic tools, user help, domain or mesh partitioning, machine and data selection, visualization, and various other tasks. Its total size is well over 1 million lines code. Its open-ended software architecture consists of several software layers. The top layer is an interactive graphical interface for specifying the PDE model and its solution framework This interface saves that results of the user specification in the form of a very high level PDE language which is an alternative interface to the PELLPACK system. This language also allows a user to specify the PDE problem and its solution framework textually in a natural form. The PELLPACK language preprocessor generates a Fortran control program with the interfaces, calls to specified components and libraries of the PDE solution framework, and functions defining the PDE problem. The PELLPACK program execution is supported by a hign-level tool where the virtual parallel system is defined, where the compilation, loading, and execution are controlled. Finally, the PELLPACK PSE integrates several PDE libraries and PDE systems based on the decomposition of discrete geometric data to map sparse PDE computations to parallel machines. An instance of the system is available as a Web server (WebPELLPACK) for public use at http://pellpack.cs.purdue.edu.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical technique for elastic wave modelling in 3D heterogeneous media with surface topography, which is called the 3D grid method in this paper. This work is an extension of the 2D grid method that models P-SV wave propagation in 2D heterogeneous media. Similar to the finite-element method in the discretization of a numerical mesh, the proposed scheme is flexible in incorporating surface topography and curved interfaces; moreover it satisfies the free-surface boundary conditions of 3D topography naturally. The algorithm, developed from a parsimonious staggered-grid scheme, solves the problem using integral equilibrium around each node, instead of satisfying elastodynamic differential equations at each node as in the conventional finite-difference method. The computational cost and memory requirements for the proposed scheme are approximately the same as those used by the same order finite-difference method. In this paper, a mixed tetrahedral and parallelepiped grid method is presented; and the numerical dispersion and stability criteria on the tetrahedral grid method and parallelepiped grid method are discussed in detail. The proposed scheme is successfully tested against an analytical solution for the 3D Lamb problem and a solution of the boundary method for the diffraction of a hemispherical crater. Moreover, examples of surface-wave propagation in an elastic half-space with a semi-cylindrical trench on the surface and 3D plane-layered model are presented.},

We discuss and compare two implementations of the code: one that has maximum efficiency but is limited to the memory size of the card, and one that can handle larger problems but that is less efficient. We use a coloring scheme to handle efficiently summation operations over nodes on a topology with variable valence.

	abstract = {Interdigital transducers (IDT) is a classical technique for surface acoustic wave transduction. Usual IDT's make use of electrodes with limited heights, so that surface mode properties do not differ significantly from those of a free or a fully metalized surface. We have proposed previously (J Appl.Phys., 90(5):2492, 2001; Appl. Phys. Lett., 89:083515, 2006.) an experimental and theoretical analysis of the transduction of SAW under a metallic array of electrodes with a large aspect ratio on a piezoelectric substrate, whereby allowing the electrode height to become larger than one wavelength. The multimode character of SAW propagation was observed and the explicit dependence of the SAW velocities as a function of the electrode height was obtained experimentally. Up to a 10-fold slowing of surface waves was observed, with the phase velocity dropping from 4000 m/s down to 450 m/s. We present additional results on the polarization and the dispersion of the surface waves trapped by high aspect ratio electrode arrays. A finite element model, including periodic boundary conditions along the propagation direction and a perfectly matched layer (PML) to absorb waves away from the surface, was implemented. The modal shapes of all resonances can thus be identified precisely, giving access to the polarization of the surface waves. In addition, the vertical vibrations of the IDT surface were monitored using a heterodyne optical probe and confirm computations. The dispersion of the surface modes was further characterized by computing maps of the harmonic admittance and polarization as a function of frequency and wave vector. From these maps, band diagrams are obtained and complete the picture of the dispersion of the trapped surface modes. In particular, the group velocity can be obtained for all wave vector values.},

Therefore, it is important to develop exact measurement and simulation methods which are able to determine these loss parameters accurately. By the use of special boundary conditions, the finite element method (FEM) is able to fulfill these requirements. Regarding the periodic substructure of common SAW devices, we have incorporated periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in our simulation code. The piezoelectric substrate of SAW devices operating at high frequencies can be modeled as a semi-infinite half space. Therefore, we introduce newly evolved absorbing boundary conditions. They allow us to examine effects emerging from bulk acoustic wave (BAW) radiation (e.g. bulk wave onset frequencies) and assess propagation loss due to leakage and bulk wave conversion accurately.},

The latter are termed “surface transverse waves” (STW), and they have comparatively low attenuation values when operated in liquids. Later Love wave devices were developed, which used a film resonance effect to significantly reduce attenuation. All of these sensor approaches were accompanied by the development of appropriate sensing films. First attempts used simple layers of adsorbed antibodies. Later approaches used various types of covalently bound layers, for example those utilizing intermediate hydrogel layers. Recent approaches involve SAW biosensor devices inserted into compact systems with integrated fluidics for sample handling. To achieve this, the SAW biosensors can be embedded into micromachined polymer housings. Combining these two features will extend the system to create versatile biosensor arrays for generic lab use or for diagnostic purposes. SAW based biosensor immersed in a sample flow. Analyte molecules binding to the immobilized antibodies on the sensor surface will influence the velocity of the SAW and hence the output signal generated by the driving electronics.},

These devices, both of which utilize ST-cut quartz substrates, allow the frequency dependence of SAW sensor perturbations to be examined, aiding in the elucidation of the operative interaction mechanism(s). A four-frequency device with nominal SAW center frequencies of 16, 40, 100, and 250 MHz is designed in such a way that all four sets of transducers probe a common region of a thin film deposited in the wave path. A seven-frequency SAW device is designed and fabricated with nominal Rayleigh-wave center frequencies ranging from 25 to 200 MHz in [radical sign]2 multiples; each pair of transducers probes a distinct region of a thin film on the active area of the device. For the seven-frequency device, transducer periodicity, finger length, and center-to-center transducer separation all scale with the reciprocal of the center frequency. Measurements of the SAW response to the vacuum deposition of a thin nickel film show the expected frequency dependence of mass sensitivity and the acoustoelectric effect. Coating multifrequency devices with a thin polymer film allows the frequency-dependent changes in the viscoelastic properties of the polymer to be studied as a function of temperature and of the concentration of various organic solvents, which in turn provides a means for selective chemical detection of these compounds. By measuring changes in both wave velocity and attenuation at multiple frequencies, extrinsic perturbations such as temperature and pressure changes are readily differentiated from one another and from changes in surface mass and other perturbations.},

Morphological analysis showed that the AlN layer is compact with grain dimensions of less than 80 nm. Polyaniline nanofibers were polymerized from the reactions in which an oxidant was rapidly mixed with the aniline monomer in an acidic environment. The polymer was synthesized in camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) to obtain 50 nm average diameter polyaniline nanofibers. These nanofibers were deposited on the layered SAW device and were tested towards hydrogen (H2) gas while operating at room temperature. The device demonstrated a large and reproducible response to different concentrations of the H2 gas making it an ideal candidate for H2 sensing at room temperature.},

The sensor's performance was analyzed in terms of frequency shift as a function of different gas concentrations. The sensors were tested over a range of operating temperatures between 100 and 273 °C. A large response magnitude with fast response and recovery time was observed. Positive frequency shifts of 91 kHz for 2.125 ppm of NO2 and negative frequency shifts of 319 kHz for 1\% of H2 in synthetic air are presented; demonstrating the high sensitivity of the layered SAW structure with the DC sputtered InOx thin film. The surface of the layered SAW structure was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) before and after the deposition of the InOx selective layer.

This new explicit TDFEM is derived from a recently developed TDFEM domain-decomposition algorithm by extending domain decomposition to the element level. This method solves dual-field second-order wave equations and computes the electric and magnetic fields in a leapfrog fashion. With the element-level decomposition, no global system matrix has to be assembled and solved as required in the implicit TDFEM, and each element is related to its neighboring elements in an explicit manner. Hence, the computational complexity of the method is reduced to only O(N) for both computer memory and CPU time. A hybrid explicit/implicit scheme is also proposed to alleviate a major disadvantage of the proposed explicit TDFEM formulation. In addition, the convergence behavior of the corresponding higher order algorithms and the stability issues are discussed},

These studies include those of ultrasonic transducers and electro-mechanical devices. In FDTD formulations, the first-order set of partial differential equations given by the constitutive equations are discretized using a leap-frog finite-difference scheme. When a high-contrast discontinuity, especially a free surface, is present, some difficulties arise due to the spatially staggered nature of the grid of the FDTD approach, with neither all the velocity variables nor all the stress variables appearing on the same grid lines. The present study considers the following modifications to the FDTD approach: a standard staggered grid for anisotropic elastic wave fields is rotated so that the diagonal directions of the standard grid lie parallel to the axes of the analysis region. This configuration, called the diagonally staggered grid (DSG), improves the accuracy of the implementation of free boundaries without requiring virtual grids in a vacuum area. The effectiveness of DSG was verified by applying this method to model problems of isotropic and anisotropic solid materials.},

The employed variant of the PML approach relies on a complex variable transformation of the basic piezoelectric equations in the PML layer. Harmonic admittances of a system with aluminum electrodes on a 42deg YX- LiTaO3 substrate are determined with PML and ABC methods and compared to FEM/BEM results, which can be considered as exact solution of the piezoelectric half space problem. The results of PML approach FEM/BEM, while the ABC results deviate.

The term `elastic variables' refers to stresses and particle velocities. Velocity potentials can be directly derived using the same leap-frog finite-difference scheme as in the FDTD method. In some situations, for example, where an absorbing boundary is present, it is more straightforward to calculate using velocity potentials. This approach also provides an easy way to handle of complex elastic wave phenomena. On the other hand, many other types of boundary conditions are often expressed in terms of elastic variables. In these situations, it is more convenient to use elastic variables for calculation. Some examples are introduced here to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed technique. First, the method was used for the case of an absorbing boundary. In the model, almost all analysis was carried out using values of stress and particle velocity, but velocity potentials were applied near the absorbing boundary on the truncated interface. Second, an interface between elastic variables and velocity potentials, namely a stress-velocity/potentials interface, was constructed around a scattering object. External to the interface, stresses and particle velocities were used for calculation, and potential variables were applied inside the interface. In a third example, calculations were made over almost the entire analytical region using potential values, but in the neighborhood of the free boundary, elastic variables were used. All the examples above were analyzed numerically using the FDTD method, and the results confirmed the usefulness of the method.},

	abstract = {Film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) technology, which is used for the design and fabrication of microwave filters, is discussed. Filters are presented which exhibit a combination of low loss, small size, and frequency and bandwidth not attainable by any other type of device. Using a piezoelectric film of zinc oxide as a high Q crystal resonator along with passive components an integrable, high performance bandpass filter is formed. The range of center frequencies achievable is roughly 1 to 5 GHz using current resonator designs. The technique features potentially low cost (since the filters are fabricated by batch processing), and, perhaps most intriguing, the capability of being combined with more complex functions (such as a complete radar receiver) as part of a larger mask set. Other advantages such as moderate power handling capability, good temperature stability, and high dynamic range are discussed},

	abstract = {We present a 3-D coupled-field finite-element model of a novel hexagonal surface acoustic wave (SAW) device which finds applications in materials characterization, as well as in chemical and biological sensing. Calculated frequency response as well as wave propagation characteristics along the three different delay paths corresponding to crystal orientations with Euler angles (0, 90, 90), (0, 90, 30), and (0, 90, 150) for a LiNbO3 substrate are analyzed using this finite-element structural model. The transient response of the hexagonal SAW device upon application of an impulse electrical input at the transmitting interdigital transducer fingers is utilized to deduce its frequency response. The amplitude fields as well as displacement contours, generated in an AC analysis, along the SAW delay-line and substrate depth are analyzed and utilized to evaluate the wave propagation characteristics along the three propagation directions in this hexagonal SAW device. Our findings indicate that the acoustic waves generated in the three Euler directions are very different in character. The (0, 90, 30) and (0, 90, 150) directions have mixed modes with a prominent shear-horizontal component, whereas the (0, 90, 90) direction generates a Rayleigh wave. This allows the hexagonal device based on LiNbO3 to be used for rapid and simultaneous extraction of multiple parameters (film material density, Lame and shear modulii, sheet conductivity) of a thin-film material and achieve a more complete characterization in comparison to a conventional SAW device. Comparison of the simulation results with those obtained using perturbational models and experiments shows good agreement. This validation enables the consideration of such complicated device configurations for practical application, and allows for extending the developed models to analyze propagation characteristics in these SAW devices based on other bare and multilayered piezoelectric substrates prior to fabrication.},

To best exploit these opportunities we need toaugment standard design procedures based on 1D models and prototypeexperiments. Rigorous finite element computer modeling offers a powerfuladjunct to conventional methods, yet it has enjoyed only limitedacceptance despite major industry efforts. One reason is reliance ontraditional implicit numerical algorithms for frequency-domain analysisor time integration. We present an alternative mixed explicit/implicitalgorithm for direct time-domain integration of the 2D or 3Delectromechanical equations. On the same workstation it affords abouttwo orders of magnitude faster solutions or larger models than doavailable implicit codes, and makes desktop transient device modelingpractical.

The other difficulty is the 3D effects that could have a major impact on performances, especially when using ladder type filters. The third effect is the impact of electrical stray elements which can no longer be neglected. Our model can be separated in different parts. The acoustical model is used to analyze resonators or transducers. For this purpose, one possibility is to characterize test devices. We prefer to base our design directly on theoretical results. One way is to use the periodic FEM/BEM model to extract physical parameters describing the propagation of the wave and to use these parameters in a phenomenological model similar to COM or P matrix. This approach is well suited to periodic or almost periodic structures, as for example the resonators inside a ladder filter.},

Military applications required wide-band and tunable devices for electronic support measures receivers, which led to the development of highly selective wide-band waveguide filters, coaxial resonator and suspended-substrate multiplexers, and electronically tunable filters. The satellite communications industry created demand for low-mass narrow-band low-loss filters with severe specifications on amplitude selectivity and phase linearity. These requirements resulted in the development of dual-mode waveguide and dielectric-resonator filters, and advances in the design of contiguous multiplexers. Cellular communications base-stations demanded low-loss high power-handling selective filters with small physical size, capable of being manufactured in tens of thousands at a reasonable cost. These demands led to advances in coaxial resonator, dielectric resonator, and superconducting filters, and also to methods of cost-reduction, including computer-aided alignment. Cellular radio handsets have required the manufacture of hundreds of millions of extremely small very low-cost filters, still with reasonably low loss and high selectivity.

Using a viscoelastic, finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) method with the simplified cancellous bone model, ultrasound pulse waveforms propagating through cancellous bone were simulated in two cases of the propagations parallel and perpendicular to the main trabecular orientation. The porosity dependences of the propagation properties, attenuation, and propagation speed were derived from the simulated waveforms. Comparisons with simulated results using the realistic cancellous bone model reconstructed from a 3-D muCT image, assisted to further validate this simplified model.},

	abstract = {The manner in which ultrasound interacts with bone is of key interest in therapy and diagnosis alike. These may include applications directly to bone, as, for example, in treatment to accelerate the healing of bone fractures and in assessment of bone density in osteoporosis, or indirectly in diagnostic imaging of soft tissue with interest in assessing exposure levels to nearby bone. Because of the lack of analytic solutions to virtually every "practical problem" encountered clinically, ultrasound simulation has become a widely used technique for evaluating ultrasound interactions in bone. This paper provides an overview of the use of ultrasound simulation in bone. A brief description of the mathematical model used to characterize ultrasound propagation in bone is first provided. A number of simulation examples are then presented that explain how simulation may be utilized in a variety of practical configurations. The focus of this paper in terms of examples presented is on diagnostic applications in bone, and, in particular, for assessment of osteoporosis. However, the use of simulation in other areas of interest can easily be extrapolated from the examples presented. In conclusion, this paper describes the use of ultrasound simulation in bone and demonstrates the power of computational methods for ultrasound research in general and tissue and bone applications in particular.},

	abstract = {Many surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices consist of quasiperiodic structures that are designed by successive repetition of a base cell. The precise numerical simulation of such devices, including all physical effects, is currently beyond the capacity of high-end computation. Therefore, we have to restrict the numerical analysis to the periodic substructure. By using the finite-element method (FEM), this can be done by introducing periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) at special artificial boundaries. To be able to describe the complete dispersion behavior of waves, including damping effects, the PBC has to be able to model each mode that can be excited within the periodic structure. Therefore, the condition used for the PBCs must hold for each phase and amplitude difference existing at periodic boundaries. Based on the Floquet theorem, our two newly developed PBC algorithms allow the calculation of both, the phase and the amplitude coefficients of the wave. In the first part of this paper we describe the basic theory of the PBCs. Based on the FEM, we develop two different methods that deliver the same results but have totally different numerical properties and, therefore, allow the use of problem-adapted solvers. Further on, we show how to compute the charge distribution of periodic SAW structures with the aid of the new PBCs. In the second part, we compare the measured and simulated dispersion behavior of waves propagating on periodic SAW structures for two different piezoelectric substrates. Then we compare measured and simulated input admittances of structures similar to SAW resonators.},

	abstract = {The accurate analysis of surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter is very challenging task for SAW designers. Especially the prediction of losses in RF-filters employing leaky surface acoustic waves (LSAWs) with aperiodically arranged metallic electrodes such as DMS-filters is not possible with conventional CMO-, P-matrix or equivalent-circuit models, since these approaches ignore relevant second-order effects: neither the weak guiding of the LSAWs near the upper stop-band edge nor radiation into bulk-waves are accounted for correctly. However, bulk-wave radiation causes increased insertion loss (in particular near the upper pass-band edge) and deteriorates the steepness of the upper skirt. Therefore, it is a matter of special importance. We have developed and implemented an accurate model for acoustic tracks with the 2D approximation only: to describe the electro-acoustical properties of the piezoelectric substrate a boundary element formulation is used, which is based on a semi-infinite dyadic Green's function, avoiding any compromises in the characterization of the physics of bulk-wave interactions. The mechanical behaviour of the electrodes is described with finite elements since this approach provides high flexibility with respect to the geometry and material composition. Due to the fact that the FEM/BEM model does not make any a priori assumptions concerning crystal cuts and/or wave types employed in the simulated device, it is widely applicable. Since well-adapted shape functions are used for the BEM-part of the model, the size of the discretized system is kept to a minimum, thereby enabling the simulation of acoustic tracks with up to 400 electrodes in reasonable CPU times on a PC. To guarantee an accurate description of real SAW-devices, a model for finite finger resistance as well as a tool for the description of the electromagnetic effects on the chip and in the package is attached to the FEM/BEM-model. Comparison between simulations and measurements on real SAW-devices show (i) very good agreement and (ii) proof the effectiveness of the developed simulation tool.},

We compare the F-SAW device to a conventional SAW device with similar substrate dimensions and transducer finger periodicity. SAW devices with concentrically shaped focused interdigital transducer fingers (F-IDTs) are found to excite waves with high intensity and high beam-width compression ratio, confined to a small localized area. F-SAW devices are more sensitive to amplitude variations at regions close to the focal point than conventional SAW devices having uniform IDT configuration. We compute F-SAW induced streaming forces and velocity fields by applying a successive approximation technique to the Navier-Stokes equation (Nyborg¿s theory). The maximum streaming force obtained at the focal point varies as the square of the applied input voltage. Computed streaming velocities at the focal point in F-SAW devices are at least an order of magnitude higher than those in conventional SAW devices. Simulated frequency response indicates higher insertion losses in F-SAW devices than in conventional devices, reflecting their greater utility as actuators than as sensors. Our simulation findings suggest that F-SAW devices can be utilized effectively for actuation in microfluidic applications involving diffusion limited transport processes.},

In the analysis, the finite element method (FEM) is used for the grating region while the spectral domain analysis (SDA) is applied for an isotropic overlay region as well as a piezoelectric substrate region. The combination of the FEM and SDA makes the numerical analysis very fast and precise. As an example, the analysis was made on the PBAWs propagating in an SiO2 overlay/ Cu grating/rotated Y-cut LiNbO3 structure. It is shown that both the shear-horizontal (SH) type and Rayleigh-type PBAWs are supported in the structure, and that their velocities are very close to each other. Thus spurious responses due to the Rayleigh-type PBAW should completely be suppressed for device implementation. Discussions are made in detail on the influence of Cu grating thickness, substrate rotation angle, and metallization ratio on excitation and propagation characteristics of the SH- and Rayleigh-type PBAWs.},

All cancellous bone models have an oriented trabecular structure, and their trabecular elements are gradually eroded to increase the porosity using an image processing technique. Three erosion procedures are presented to realize various changes in the trabecular microstructure with increasing porosity. FDTD simulations of the ultrasound pulse waves propagating through the cancellous bone models at each eroded step are performed in 2 cases of the propagations parallel and perpendicular to the major trabecular orientation. The propagation properties of the wave amplitudes and propagation speeds are derived as a function of the porosity, and their variability due to the trabecular microstructure is revealed. To elucidate an effect of the microstructure, the mean intercept length (MIL), which is a microstructural parameter, is introduced, and the correlations of the propagation properties with the MILs of the trabecular elements and pore spaces are investigated.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a simple asymptotic method to compute wave propagation in a multilayered general anisotropic piezoelectric medium is discussed. The method is based on explicit second and higher order asymptotic representations of the transfer and stiffness matrices for a thin piezoelectric layer. Different orders of the asymptotic expansion are obtained using Pade approximation of the transfer matrix exponent. The total transfer and stiffness matrices for thick layers or multilayers are calculated with high precision by subdividing them into thin sublayers and combining recursively the thin layer transfer and stiffness matrices. The rate of convergence to the exact solution is the same for both transfer and stiffness matrices; however, it is shown that the growth rate of the round-off error with the number of recursive operations for the stiffness matrix is twice that for the transfer matrix; and the stiffness matrix method has better performance for a thick layer. To combine the advantages of both methods, a hybrid method which uses the transfer matrix for the thin layer and the stiffness matrix for the thick layer is proposed. It is shown that the hybrid method has the same stability as the stiffness matrix method and the same round-off error as the transfer matrix method. The method converges to the exact transfer/stiffness matrices essentially with the precision of the computer round-off error. To apply the method to a semispace substrate, the substrate was replaced by an artificial perfect matching layer. The computational results for such an equivalent system are identical with those for the actual system. In our computational experiments, we have found that the advantage of the asymptotic method is its simplicity and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Piezoelectric materials for acoustic wave applications have changed markedly over the past 20 years in terms of both the types of materials available and the quality of individual samples. The total family of acoustic wave materials now includes piezoelectric glass-ceramics having crystallographic and polar orientation and crystals having symmetry classes mm2, 32, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, and 4¯3m. The symmetry classes 6mm and 4¯3m also occur frequently in piezoelectric semiconductor materials that are now available in both bulk and thin-film configurations. In this paper, we bring together and extract the various reported values of the material constants mainly of interest for surface acoustic wave (SAW) device applications. We identify for the user community those sets of constants from which SAW design calculations can reliably be made, and discuss the constants and their reliability for langasite, lithium niobate/lithium tantalate, and dilithium tetraborate. The relevant material constants include: mass density ρ, elastic stiffness cij, piezoelectric stress e ij, dielectric permittivity εii, and the thermal expansion coefficients αii. Except for the semiconductor materials, only data published after 1978 are included, since the reference literature (Landolt-Bornstein) amply covers those years prior to 1978},

	abstract = {This paper gives a historical account of the development of Rayleigh-wave, or surface acoustic wave (SAW), devices for applications in electronics. The subject was spurred on initially by the requirements of pulse compression radar, and became a practical reality with the planar interdigital transducer, dating from 1965. The accessibility of the propagation path gave rise to substantial versatility, and a huge variety of devices were developed. Passive SAW devices are now ubiquitous, with applications ranging from professional radar and communications systems to consumer areas such as TV, pagers and mobile phones. The paper describes the extensive work, particularly in the 1970s, to investigate SAW propagation in crystalline media, including piezoelectric coupling diffraction and temperature effects. This led to identification of many suitable materials. Concurrently, many devices began development, including pulse compression filters, bandpass filters, resonators, oscillators, convolvers and matched filters for spread spectrum. In the 1970s, many of these became established in professional systems, and the SAW bandpass filter became a standard component for domestic TV. In the 1980s and 9Os, SAW responded to the new call for low-loss filters, particularly for mobile phones. With losses as low as 2 dB required (and subsequently achieved) at RF frequencies around 900 MHz, a raft of new technologies was developed. Additionally, for IF filters special techniques were evolved to reduce the physical size needed for narrow bandwidths. Such devices are now manufactured in very large quantities. In order to satisfy these needs, new types of surface wave, particularly transverse leaky waves, were investigated, and materials using such waves now have their place alongside more traditional materials},

	shorttitle = {Microelectromechanical resonator-based components for wireless communications},
	abstract = {Starting in the early 1960's, when the integrated-circuit (IC) technology was developed, micromachining and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have grown into a broad research field with several commercial successes. Typical applications of MEMS are in physical, chemical and biochemical sensors, as well as in optical systems such as the digital micromirror device of Texas Instruments. From the 1990's, the advances in the processing technologies and the tremendous growth of the wireless-communication market have drawn much interest into radio-frequency MEMS devices (RF MEMS) such as filters, oscillators, switches and tunable capacitors. These are now beginning to penetrate the market. This thesis considers electrostatically-actuated RF-MEMS filters and delay lines. For filters, the work concentrates on nonlinear distortion and filter design. The intermodulation properties of capacitively-coupled MEMS filters are analytically solved in closed form and the theory is verified in numerical simulations as well as in measurements with MEMS resonators. The analysis is more generally valid than the previously published results. The theory is utilized to formulate a design procedure for MEMS filters that, for the first time, takes systems specifications for tolerable intermodulation distortion and insertionloss into account. For delay lines, capacitive actuation of bulk-acoustic waves in a solid rod is analyzed. In particular, challenges in impedance matching due to the weakness of the electrostatic coupling are quantified. Finally, a new kind of resonator-chain delay line for high-frequency (HF) signals is introduced. This delay line is characterized by extremely slow signal group velocity ( [similar to] 10-100 m/s), narrow-band response, and much lower characteristic impedance than found for the solid-rod waveguide enabling efficient signal coupling. Properties of the resonator-chain waveguide are theoretically analyzed and the results are verified in measurements of fabricated devices. Copyright VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland 2006.},

Microwave acoustic components inherently have several distinct physical origins including volume acoustic waves in solids excited by piezoelectric thin-film transducers and magnetic propagating modes in yttrium iron garnet, both at conventional microwave frequencies; the later surface acoustic-wave (SAW) technology for operation at VHF/UHF and the realm of acoustooptics, which can embody any of the earlier three.

Once the surface impedance tensor for a single layer is calculated, a simple recursive algorithm allows the evaluation of the surface impedance tensor for any number of layers. As an example, the surface impedance tensor is used to find the dispersion curves for a bilaminated piezoelec tric plate. Also the dispersion curves for the subsonic interfacial waves when the plate is in contact with a nonconducting acoustic fluid is investigated.

Electrical input impedance of the resonator is derived in terms of the Z-matrix of both the piezoelectric layer and an external load, the unique expression applies whether the resonator is a mono- or electroded-layer or a solidly mounted resonator (SMR). The loading effects of AZ-electrodes on the resonating frequencies of the piezoelectric ZnO-layer are analyzed. Transmission and reflection properties of Bragg mirrors are investigated along with the bulk radiation in SMR.

	abstract = {Dynamic rupture of a 3-D spontaneous crack of arbitrary shape is investigated using a finite volume (FV) approach. The full domain is decomposed in tetrahedra whereas the surface, on which the rupture takes place, is discretized with triangles that are faces of tetrahedra. First of all, the elastodynamic equations are described into a pseudo-conservative form for an easy application of the FV discretization. Explicit boundary conditions are given using criteria based on the conservation of discrete energy through the crack surface. Using a stress-threshold criterion, these conditions specify fluxes through those triangles that have suffered rupture. On these broken surfaces, stress follows a linear slip-weakening law, although other friction laws can be implemented. For The Problem Version 3 of the dynamic-rupture code verification exercise conducted by the SCEC/USGS, numerical solutions on a planar fault exhibit a very high convergence rate and are in good agreement with the reference one provided by a finite difference (FD) technique. For a non-planar fault of parabolic shape, numerical solutions agree satisfactorily well with those obtained with a semi-analytical boundary integral method in terms of shear stress amplitudes, stopping phases arrival times and stress overshoots. Differences between solutions are attributed to the low-order interpolation of the FV approach, whose results are particularly sensitive to the mesh regularity (structured/unstructured). We expect this method, which is well adapted for multiprocessor parallel computing, to be competitive with others for solving large scale dynamic ruptures scenarios of seismic sources in the near future.},

	abstract = {ADER schemes are recent finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, which can be viewed as generalizations of the classical first order Godunov method to arbitrary high orders. In the ADER approach, high order polynomial reconstruction from cell averages is combined with high order flux evaluation, where the latter is done by solving generalized Riemann problems across cell interfaces. Currently available nonlinear ADER schemes are restricted to Cartesian meshes. This paper proposes an adaptive nonlinear finite volume ADER method on unstructured triangular meshes for scalar conservation laws, which works with WENO reconstruction. To this end, a customized stencil selection scheme is developed, and the flux evaluation of previous ADER schemes is extended to triangular meshes. Moreover, an a posteriori error indicator is used to design the required adaption rules for the dynamic modification of the triangular mesh during the simulation. The expected convergence orders of the proposed ADER method are confirmed by numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear scalar conservation laws. Finally, the good performance of the adaptive ADER method, in particular its robustness and its enhanced flexibility, is further supported by numerical results concerning Burgers equation.},

After transformations for building up the partial differential system following explicit conservative law, we design an unstructured bi-dimensional time-domain numerical formulation of the crack problem. As a result, arbitrary non-planar faults can be explicitly represented without extra computational cost. On these complex surfaces, boundary conditions are set on stress fluxes and not on stress values. Prescribed rupture velocity gives accurate solutions with respect to analytical ones depending on the mesh refinement, while solutions for spontaneous propagation are analysed through numerical means. An example of non-planar spontaneous fault growth in heterogeneous media demonstrates the good behaviour of the proposed algorithm as well as specific difficulties of such numerical modelling.},

The scheme treats the fractures as the non-welded interfaces that satisfy the linear-slip displacement-discontinuity conditions, instead of using the equivalent medium theories. We develop the scheme following a so-called 3-D grid method. The key to derive the scheme is to extend the integral forms of the elastic-momentum equations to include the linear-slip displacement-discontinuity (LS) model. The scheme is implemented under a discretization of tetrahedral grid cells. Arbitrary 2-D non-planar fractures can be explicitly, accurately represented on the numerical mesh. The scheme can flexibly accommodate arbitrary 2-D fractures with fracture behaviour from one extreme of being perfectly welded to an extreme characterized by the stress-free conditions. No stability problem arises. In comparison with the seismic response calculation in the background medium in the absence of the fractures, the additional computational cost and memory requirements for incorporating many fractures are small. We propose a parallel numerical implementation of the scheme that needs smaller data exchanges between the subdomains. We also present the comparisons with an equivalent-medium based modelling scheme in the numerical examples.},

	abstract = {A general theory is developed for studying changes of a wave train governed by non-linear partial differential equations. The technique is to average over the local oscillations in the medium and so obtain differential equations for the variations in amplitude, wave number, etc. It corresponds to the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging technique for the ordinary differential equations of non-linear vibrations. The equations obtained in this way are hyperbolic and can be handled by the usual theory of quasi-linear hyperbolic systems, involving the theory of characteristics and shock waves. In this case the 'shocks' are abrupt changes in the amplitude, wave number, etc. They do not involve dissipation, but it turns out that frequency plays the role corresponding to entropy in ordinary gas dynamic shocks. It is not clear whether these shocks will really occur in practice. However, they have a number of interesting properties and seem to be relevant to the discussion of so-called collisionless shocks in plasma dynamics. The main applications envisaged are to water waves and plasma dynamics, and the theory is developed using typical equations from these areas. If the original equations are linear, this theory predicts the usual description of dispersive waves in terms of group velocity, so it may be considered as an extension of the group velocity concept to non-linear problems. Mathematically, the theory may be considered as an extension of some of the methods and ideas for the non-linear ordinary differential equations of vibration theory to partial differential equations.},

Beginning with rigorous derivations of mathematical formulas for the numerical reflection coefficient, it is shown that wave impedance for the travelling wave and phase shift between the standing wave E- and H-fields are conserved. However, field discontinuity across the mesh discontinuity results thereupon. As a consequence the Poynting vector increases when the wave travels from fine to coarse mesh, and decreases in the opposite case. The Poynting theorem and reciprocity condition are violated. In standard FDTD, these numerical artifacts are at the level of-32 dB for the benchmarking case of ten coarse cells per wavelength and 10:1 mesh grading ratio. The compensated FDTD scheme suppresses the nonphysical effects to the level of -60 dB, which is practically undetectable in FDTD analyses of real problems. IEE, 2004.},

	abstract = {A numerical technique for wave-propagation simulation in 2-D heterogeneous anisotropic structures is presented. The scheme is flexible in incorporating arbitrary surface topography, inner openings, liquid/solid boundaries, and irregular interfaces, and it naturally satisfies the free-surface conditions of complex geometrical boundaries. The algorithm, based on a discretization mesh of triangles and quadrilaterals, solves the problem using integral equilibrium around each node instead of satisfying elastodynamic differential equations at each node as in the finite-difference method. This study is an extension of previous work for the elastic-isotropic case. Besides accounting for anisotropy, a simplified quadrilateral grid cell with low computational cost is introduced. The transversely isotropic medium with a symmetry axis on the horizontal or vertical plane, as typically caused by a system of parallel cracks or fine layers, is discussed in detail. A 2-D algorithm is presented that can handle the situation where the symmetry axis of the anisotropy does not lie in the 2-D plane. The proposed scheme is successfully tested against an analytical solution for Lamb's problem with a symmetry axis normal to the surface and agrees well with a numerical solution of the reflectivity method for a plane-layered model in the isotropic case. Computed radiation patterns show characteristics such as shear-wave splitting and triplications of quasi-SV wavefronts, as predicted by the theory. Examples of surface-wave propagation in an anisotropic half-space with a semicylindrical pit on the surface and mixed liquid/(anisotropic) solid model with an inclined liquid/solid interface are presented. Moreover, seismograms are modeled for dome-layered and plane-layered anisotropic structures.},

	abstract = {This is an attempt to study 3-D wave propagation in a general anisotropic poroelastic medium. Biot's theory is used to derive a modified Christoffel equation for the propagation of plane harmonic waves in an anisotropic fluid-saturated porous solid. This equation is solved further to obtain a biquadratic equation, the roots of which represent the phase velocities of all the four quasi-waves that may propagate in such a medium. These phase velocities vary with the direction of phase propagation. Expressions are derived to calculate the group velocities of all the four quasi-waves without using numerical differentiation. The eigensystem of modified Christoffel equation is used to calculate the polarizations of all the quasi-waves. The particle motion of each wave is a function of the direction of phase propagation. Some fundamental differences between wave propagation in anisotropic poroelastic medium and anisotropic elastic medium are suggested, an interesting one is that in an anisotropic poroelastic medium, the polarizations of different quasi-waves need not be mutually orthogonal. In the anisotropic poroelastic medium, the motion of fluid particles deviates from solid particles and this deviation varies, also, with the matrix porosity. Propagation regimes for an isotropic medium, giving velocities and polarizations of both compressional and shear waves, are obtained as special cases. The variations of phase velocity, group velocity, ray direction with phase direction (in 3-D space), are plotted for a numerical model of general anisotropic poroelastic solid. The same numerical model is used to plot the deviations of polarizations from phase direction and ray direction. The deviations among the motion in fluid of the particles and solid parts of porous aggregate are also plotted.},

Moreover, a simple domain imbedding precedure is introduced to solve problems with an obstacle in the water volume.

	abstract = {Numerical methods for the two- and three-dimensional Boussinesq equations governing weakly nonlinear and dispersive water waves are presented and investigated. Convenient handling of grids adapted to the geometry or bottom topography is enabled by finite element discretization in space. Staggered finite difference schemes are used for the temporal discretization, resulting in only two linear systems to be solved during each time step. Efficient iterative solution of linear systems is discussed. By introducing correction terms in the equations, a fourth-order, two-level temporal scheme can be obtained. Combined with (bi-) quadratic finite elements, the truncation errors of this scheme can be made of the same order as the neglected perturbation terms in the analytical model, provided that the element size is of the same order as the characteristic depth. We present analysis of the proposed schemes in terms of numerical dispersion relations. Verification of the schemes and their implementations is performed for standing waves in a closed basin with constant depth. More challenging applications cover plane incoming waves on a curved beach and earthquake induced waves over a shallow seamount. In the latter example we demonstrate a significantly increased computational efficiency when using higher-order schemes and bathymetry-adapted finite element grids. Corresponding author.},

Once the array-related operations are efficiently implemented, probably using a mixed-language implementation, good serial and parallel performance become achievable.

	abstract = {We evaluate the fundamental solution of the hyperbolic system describing the generation and propagation of elastic waves in an anisotropic solid by studying the homology of the algebraic hypersurface defined by the characteristic equation, also known as the “slowness” surface. Our starting point is the Herglotz-Petrovsky-Leray integral representation of the fundamental solution. We find an explicit decomposition of the latter solution into integrals over vanishing cycles associated with the isolated singularities on the slowness surface. As is well known in the theory of isolated singularities, integrals over vanishing cycles satisfy a system of differential equations known as Picard-Fuchs equations. Such equations are linear and can have at most regular singular points. We discuss a method to obtain these equations explicitly. Subsequently, we use the monodromy properties around the regular singular points to find the asymptotic behavior according to the different types of singularities that may appear on a wave front in three dimensions. This is a method alternative to the one that arises in the Maslov theory of oscillating integrals. Our work sheds new light on how to compute and classify the Cagniard-De Hoop contour in the complex radial horizontal slowness plane; this contour is used in numerical integration schemes to obtain the full time behaviour of the fundamental solution for a given direction of propagation.},

In this method, we adopt the strategy of integrating the elastic parameters over a limited space; so, it is suitable for wave propagation modelling in fractured media, for which we use an equivalent media with the elastic coefficients averaged over a fractured space. This elastic parameters integration allows us to reduce the five simultaneous equations usually used to describe the velocity and stress propagation to just two, in terms of velocity alone, providing a significant saving in computational memory. In this paper, we discuss the derivation and computational implementation of the method for 2-D media, including the seismic source and both reflecting and absorbing boundary conditions, and illustrate it with some synthetic models of heterogeneous, anisotropic and fractured media.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Recently, a series of parallel loop self-scheduling schemes have been proposed, especially for heterogeneous cluster systems.
However, they employed the MPI programming model to construct the applications without considering whether the computing node
is multicore architecture or not. As a result, every processor core has to communicate directly with the master node for requesting
new tasks no matter the fact that the processor cores on the same node can communicate with each other through the underlying
shared memory. To address the problem of higher communication overhead, in this paper we propose to adopt hybrid MPI and OpenMP
programming model to design two-level parallel loop self-scheduling schemes. In the first level, each computing node runs
an MPI process for inter-node communications. In the second level, each processor core runs an OpenMP thread to execute the
iterations assigned for its resident node. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous works.},

As an initial attempt to remedy this weakness, new 1D Courant number and Mach number insensitive CE/SE Euler solvers are developed using several key concepts underlying the recent successful development of Courant number insensitive CE/SE schemes. Numerical results indicate that the new solvers are capable of resolving crisply a contact discontinuity embedded in a flow with the maximum Mach number = 0.01.},

	abstract = {A numerical study of the spray transfer processes in an electrostatic rotary bell applicator (ESRB) has been conducted utilizing code for a newly developed simulation code. This code consists of three modularized solvers: a fluid flow solver, a spray dynamics solver, and an electrostatic solver. The development of the code consisted of the following steps. First, the flow solver designed for an unsteady three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation was developed to simulate the shaping airflow with the initial condition and the boundary condition supported by experimental data. Second, the particle trajectory solver, which interacts with the airflow by momentum coupling, was developed to apply the spray transport processes. Finally, the electrostatic solver was developed to calculate the electrostatic field within the two phase flow field. The integrated code created by combining those three solvers was then applied to simulate the paint spray transport processes according to the operating conditions of interest. The numerical results show that the spray shape is very sensitive to changes in the charge to mass ratio. The voltage setting is a dominant operating parameter affecting the numerical transfer efficiency. The voltage range studied was 0 kV to 90 kV. In addition, the transfer efficiency decreases as the shaping airflow rate increases. However, a high shaping airflow rate produces a more uniform distribution of spray mass on the target plane.},

It is explained why these ideas result in all the simplifying and enabling features of the CESE method. A thorough discussion of the a scheme, a two-level non-dissipative CESE solver of a simple advection equation with two independent mesh variables and two equations per mesh point is also presented. It is shown that the scheme possesses some rather intriguing properties such as: (i) its two independent mesh variables separately satisfy two decoupled three-level leapfrog schemes and (ii) it shares with the leapfrog scheme the same amplification factors, even though the a scheme and the leapfrog scheme have completely different origins and structures. It is also explained why the leapfrog scheme is not as robust as the a scheme. The amplification factors/matrices of several non-dissipative schemes are carefully studied and the key properties that contribute to their non-dissipatedness are clearly spelled out. Finally we define and establish space-time inversion (STI) invariance for several non-dissipative schemes and show that their non-dissipatedness is a result of their STI invariance.},

The use of the extra marching variables results from the need to construct the two-level, explicit and nondissipative schemes which are at the core of the CE/SE development. It also results from the need to minimize the stencil while maintaining accuracy. In this paper, using the 1D a-[mu] scheme as an example, the effect of this added complication on consistency, accuracy, and operation count is assessed. As part of this effort, an equivalent yet more efficient form of the a-[mu] scheme in which the independent marching variables are the local fluxes tied to each mesh point is introduced. Also, the intriguing relations that exist among the a-[mu]. Leapfrog, and DuFort-Frankel schemes are further explored. In addition, the redundancy of the Leapfrog, DuFort-Frankel, and Lax schemes and the remedy for this redundancy are discussed. This paper is concluded with the construction and evaluation of a CE/SE solver for the inviscid Burgers equation.},

	abstract = {A new high-resolution and genuinely multidimensional numerical method for solving conservation laws is being developed. It was designed to avoid the limitations of the traditional methods and was built from ground zero with extensive physics considerations. Nevertheless, its foundation is mathematically simple enough that one can build from it a coherent, robust, efficient, and accurate numerical framework. Two basic beliefs that set the new method apart from the established methods are at the core of its development. The first belief is that, in order to capture physics more efficiently and realistically, the modeling focus should be placed on the original integral form of the physical conservation laws, rather than the differential form. The latter form follows from the integral form under the additional assumption that the physical solution is smooth, an assumption that is difficult to realize numerically in a region of rapid change, such as a boundary layer or a shock. The second belief is that, with proper modeling of the integral and differential forms themselves, the resulting numerical solution should automatically be consistent with the properties derived from the integral and differential forms, e.g., the jump conditions across a shock and the properties of characteristics. Therefore a much simpler and more robust method can be developed by avoiding the explicit use of the above derived properties. Specifically, to capture physics as fully as possible, the method requires that: (i) space and time be unified and treated as a single entity; (ii) both local and global flux conservation in space and time be enforced; and (iii) a multidimensional scheme be constructed without using the dimensional-splitting approach, such that multidimensional effects and source terms (which are scalars) can be modeled more realistically. To simplify mathematics and broaden its applicability as much as possible, the method attempts to use the simplest logical structures and approximation techniques. Specifically, (i) it uses a staggered space-time mesh such that flux at any interface separating two conservation elements can be evaluated internally in a simpler and more consistent manner, without using a separate flux model; (ii) it avoids the use of many well-established techniques such as Riemann solvers, flux splittings, and monotonicity constraints such that the complications and possibly even the limitations associated with them may be avoided; and (iii) it avoids the use of special techniques that are not applicable to more general problems. Furthermore, triangles in 2D space and tetrahedrons in 3D space are used as the basic building blocks of the spatial meshes, such that the method (i) can be used to construct 2D and 3D nondissipative schemes in a natural manner; and (ii) is compatible with the simplest unstructured meshes. Note that while numerical dissipation is required for shock capturing, it may also result in annihilation of small disturbances such as sound waves and, in the case of flow with a large Reynolds number, may overwhelm physical dissipation. To overcome this difficulty, two different and mutually complementary types of adjustable numerical dissipation are introduced in the present development.},

Generally, a finite-difference analog of this equation may possess some or none of these properties. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the von Neumann amplification factor of an analog satisfies a special relation for each invariant property this analog possesses. Particularly, an analog is neutrally stable and thus free of numerical diffusion if it possesses the invariant property related to space-time inversion. It is also explained why generally (1) an upwind scheme possesses neither the invariant property related to spatial reflection nor that related to space-time inversion, and (2) an explicit scheme possesses neither the invariant property related to time reversal nor that related to space-time inversion. Extension to the viscous case and a remarkable connection between the current work and a new numerical framework for solving conservation laws are also discussed.},

As to longitudinal waves in triclinic and monoclinic materials, only few explicit expressions are possible. We also present  necessary and sufficient conditions for a transverse wave to propagate in the direction n. As an illustration, explicit expressions of all n, the polarization vector a and the wave speed c for which a transverse wave can propagate in cubic and hexagonal materials are given. The search for n in hexagonal materials confirms the known fact that a transverse wave can propagate in any direction. A longitudinal wave is necessarily accompanied by two transverse waves. However, a transverse wave can propagate without being accompanied by a longitudinal wave.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present article is to give a precise definition and analysis from first principals of anisotropy, as the term applies to elastic media, taking care to avoid unnecessary assumptions. Two fundamental concepts, material invariance and symmetry group of a material, are defined purely in terms of the stress-strain relation. The implications of material symmetry, or in other words, of anisotropy, for the structure of the stiffness tensor are then investigated. Using the reduced notation of Voigt, these results are presented as the well-known simplifications in the form taken by the six-by-six stiffness matrix that represents the material's stiffness tensor. A new, simple proof is given for the remarkable fact that an elastic medium cannot have rotational symmetry by an angle of less than 90° without being transversely isotropic. In addition, the mutual relation that the notions of elastic symmetry and crystal symmetry have with respect to the so-called orthogonal group is sketched. Despite the historical association between anisotropic elastic materials and the study of crystals, the given presentation shows that conceptually the notion of anisotropy in elastic media is entirely independent of that of crystal symmetry.},

for the calculation of the radar cross section (RCS) of complicated

have matured; the primary impediments to its implementation are the
complex geometries and material properties associated with the problem.
Even under these circumstances, FDTD is more flexible to implement
because it is based on first principles instead of a clever mathematical
trick. This paper gives an account of some new results on conformal FDTD
obtained by the authors and their associates at Lockheed Martin Space
Company since 1988. The emphasis is on nonsmooth boundary condition

Most simulations for practical 3D geometries require a large number of grid points for adequate spatial resolution making them suitable to parallel computation. The simulations have been carried out using a multi-block/zonal approach in the message passing paradigm on the SP-2. Each zone is placed on a separate processor and inter-processor communication is carried out using the Message Passing Library/Interface (MPL/MPI). Integration of Maxwell's equations is performed using the four-stage Runge-Kutta time integration method on a dual grid. This method of integrating on a staggered grid gives enhanced dissipative and dispersive characteristics. A scattered field formulation has been used and the Liao boundary condition is used at the outer nonreflecting boundary. The far zone transformation has also been implemented efficiently, using specialized MPL functions to evaluate the far zone scattering results. Results show extremely good comparisons for scattering from the sphere and the ogive with the exact solution and standard FDTD type algorithms. Comparisons for nonaxisymmetric targets like the NASA almond with experimental data has also been found to be extremely good.},

	abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

This approach is based on the decomposition of the computational domain into a number of non-overlapping subdomains wherein the CBFs are generated by employing a novel procedure, which differs from all those that have been used in the past. Clearly, the CBFs are obtained by calculating the fields radiated by a finite number of dipole-type sources, which are placed hypothetically along the boundary of the conducting object. The major advantages of the proposed technique are twofold: (i) it provides a substantial reduction in the matrix size, and thus, makes use of direct solvers efficiently and (ii) it enables the utilization of parallel processing techniques that considerably decrease the overall computation time. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach via several 3D electromagnetic scattering problems.},

If it is associated with a longitudinal wave, it is the inner slowness sheet which is disjoint from the two outer slowness sheets. The two outer slowness sheets touch each other at certain points so that there are acoustic axes of double degeneracy. The waves associated with the two outer slowness sheets are necessarily transverse waves. Therefore any plane wave in these materials is either longitudinal or transverse. If the spherical slowness surface is associated with a transverse wave, it is the medial slowness sheet. The acoustic axes are at the crystallographic axes where the spherical slowness sheet touches the inner and/or outer sheets. All three sheets can touch each other so that the acoustic axis can be of triple degeneracy. In the case of special hexagonal materials with the x3-axis being the axis of symmetry, the x3-axis is an acoustic axis of double or triple degeneracy while any line on the x3 = 0 plane is an acoustic axis of double degeneracy. We also consider anisotropic elastic materials for which a cross-section of a slowness sheet is a circle. Anisotropic elastic materials that possess a circular cross-section in the slowness surface are not restricted to hexagonal or orthotropic materials.},

	abstract = {The propagation of elastic waves in a homogeneous solid is governed by a hyperbolic system of three linear second-order partial differential equations with constant coefficients. When the solid is also isotropic, the form of these equations is well known and provides the foundation of the conventional theory of elasticity (Love 1944). The explicit solution of the initial value, or Cauchy, problem for the isotropic case was found by Poisson, and in a different way by Stokes (1883). If the initial disturbance is sharp and concentrated, the resulting disturbance at a field point will consist of an initial sharp pressure wave, a continuous wave for a certain period, and a final sharp shear wave. The disturbance then ceases. Here we shall consider a medium which is homogeneous but not isotropic, and will describe, using Fourier transforms, the elastic waves produced by a local initial disturbance. The solution again consists of a continuous wave which lasts for a definite period of time, and a number of sharp waves, but the detailed nature of the waves may, in highly anisotropic media, be very different and much more complicated. The continuous wave may arrive at a field point in advance of the first sharp wave, though it will always terminate with the last sharp wave. The number of the sharp waves may not exceed 75. The solution appears as the sum of three modes, which correspond to the three sheets of a certain wave surface. The geometry of this surface, which may be quite complicated (Musgrave 1954a), qualitatively determines the nature of the solution. These calculations may serve as a foundation for the study of time-dependent elastic waves. There is also mathematical interest in this example of a hyperbolic system for which the wave surface may have certain types of singularities not usually considered in the existing general theory of hyperbolic differential equations.},

	abstract = {Computational aeroacoustic (CAA) simulation requires accurate schemes to capture the dynamics of acoustic fluctuations, which are weak compared with aerodynamic ones. In this paper, two kinds of schemes are studied and compared: the classical approach based on high order schemes for Navier-Stokes-like equations and the lattice Boltzmann method. The reference macroscopic equations are the 3D isothermal and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A Von Neumann analysis of these linearized equations is carried out to obtain exact plane wave solutions. Three physical modes are recovered and the corresponding theoretical dispersion relations are obtained. Then the same analysis is made on the space and time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations with the classical high order schemes to quantify the influence of both space and time discretization on the exact solutions. Different orders of discretization are considered, with and without a uniform mean flow. Three different lattice Boltzmann models are then presented and studied with the Von Neumann analysis. The theoretical dispersion relations of these models are obtained and the error terms of the model are identified and studied. It is shown that the dispersion error in the lattice Boltzmann models is only due to the space and time discretization and that the continuous discrete velocity Boltzmann equation yield the same exact dispersion as the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, dispersion and dissipation errors of the different kind of schemes are quantitatively compared. It is found that the lattice Boltzmann method is less dissipative than high order schemes and less dispersive than a second order scheme in space with a 3-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time. The number of floating point operations at a given error level associated with these two kinds of schemes are then compared.},

The electromagnetic fields exert forces and torques on the induced sources in the matter and cause the latter to move and deform. Such interactions are considered for materials which can be polarized and magnetized, and which are thermally and electrically conductive, and are mechanically deformable. Balance equations of continuum mechanics are considered along with Maxwell equations for media at rest and for moving media, the Maxwell stress tensor and Minkowski energy-momentum tensor, total energy-momentum tensors, the theory of electrons and statistical mechanics, macroscopic Maxwell-Lorentz forces, magnetostatic forces on a whole body, and models for field-matter interaction.},

	abstract = {We design finite volume schemes for the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and based on splitting these equations into a fluid part and a magnetic induction part. The fluid part leads to an extended Euler system with magnetic forces as source terms. This set of equations are approximated by suitable two- and three-wave HLL solvers. The magnetic part is modeled by the magnetic induction equations which are approximated using stable upwind schemes devised in a recent paper [F. Fuchs, K.H. Karlsen, S. Mishra, N.H. Risebro, Stable upwind schemes for the Magnetic Induction equation. Math. Model. Num. Anal., Available on conservation laws preprint server, submitted for publication, URL: ]. These two sets of schemes can be combined either component by component, or by using an operator splitting procedure to obtain a finite volume scheme for the MHD equations. The resulting schemes are simple to design and implement. These schemes are compared with existing HLL type and Roe type schemes for MHD equations in a series of numerical experiments. These tests reveal that the proposed schemes are robust and have a greater numerical resolution than HLL type solvers, particularly in several space dimensions. In fact, the numerical resolution is comparable to that of the Roe scheme on most test problems with the computational cost being at the level of a HLL type solver. Furthermore, the schemes are remarkably stable even at very fine mesh resolutions and handle the divergence constraint efficiently with low divergence errors.},

They have been introduced for electromagnetic waves and extended, since then, to other models of wave propagation, including waves in elastic anisotropic media. In this last case, some numerical experiments have shown that the PMLs are not always stable. In this paper, we investigate this question from a theoretical point of view. In the first part, we derive a necessary condition for the stability of the PML model for a general hyperbolic system. This condition can be interpreted in terms of geometrical properties of the slowness diagrams and used for explaining instabilities observed with elastic waves but also with other propagation models (anisotropic Maxwell's equations, linearized Euler equations). In the second part, we specialize our analysis to orthotropic elastic waves and obtain separately a necessary stability condition and a sufficient stability condition that can be expressed in terms of inequalities on the elasticity coefficients of the model.},
