Time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) \cite{briggs_derivation_2007}:

\begin{align}
  i\frac{\partial \Psi(x, y, z, t)}{\partial t}
  &= -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\Psi + V(r)\Psi + H'(x, y, z, t)\Psi
\end{align}

$\Psi$ is the wave function.  $V(r)$ is an atomic model potential.  $H'$ is the
interaction between the atomic electron and laser field in dipole
approximation.
