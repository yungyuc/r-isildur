	abstract = {Interaction of intense lasers with solid materials offers an alternative way to achieve high-order harmonic generation (HHG). Since the underlying mechanisms of the harmonic emission remain uncertain, a large number of theoretical studies have been proposed to explain the experimental findings in this fast-growing field. Here, we review the primary numerical methods and present a brief perspective of HHG in solids.},

	abstract = {We propose an intuitive method, called the time-dependent population imaging (TDPI) method, to map the dynamical processes of high-order-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. It is shown that the real-time dynamical characteristics of HHG in solids, such as the instantaneous photon energies of emitted harmonics, can be read directly from the energy-resolved population oscillations of electrons in the TDPI picture. Meanwhile, the short and long trajectories of solid HHG are illustrated clearly from the TDPI picture. By using TDPI, we investigate the effects of the carrier-envelope phase in few-cycle pulses and demonstrate intuitively the HHG dynamics driven by two-color fields. Our results show that TDPI provides a powerful tool to study the ultrafast dynamics in strong fields for various laser-solid configurations and to gain insight into HHG processes in solids.},

	abstract = {Beginning with an entangled state of a time-independent (TI) quantum system coupled to its TI quantum environment, we show that a time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) for the quantum system alone can be derived in the limit that one of the environment variables becomes a classical variable. In the same limit the TI amplitude of the environment wavefunction becomes the TD amplitude of an eigenfunction expansion of the system TD wavefunction. Similarly, the phase of the TI environment wavefunction goes over into the TD phase of the system amplitude. By considering that more and more environment variables become successively classical, each provides a classical clock to give a multiple-time TDSE for the quantum system. Two examples of two-time TDSE given in the literature are derived. When all clocks are synchronized the multiple-time TDSE reduces to the usual one-time TDSE.},
