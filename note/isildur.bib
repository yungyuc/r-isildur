	abstract = {We present theoretical work on high-order harmonic generation accompanying multiphoton ionization of atoms in intense laser fields. We first review some elements of the theory of harmonic generation, particularly the limitations imposed by perturbation theory and some aspects of phase-matching at high pump intensities. A new non-perturbative approach to the theory based on the direct numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger wave equation is described. Selected results of this theory are presented, including: (a) evidence for a plateau of high-order harmonic peak intensities and a relatively abrupt cut-off of this plateau, closely similar to what has been reported experimentally in noble gas atoms, (b) specific predictions for harmonic production by H, He and Xe atoms, and (c) analytical and numerical evidence for the correlation of harmonic production spectra with above-threshold photoelectron spectra under certain circumstances.},

This method is based on the direct use of the acceleration of the atomic electron rather than the dipole moment of the atom. We show, using a numerical calculation in one dimension, that this method produces a more exact numerical evaluation of the spectrum. This technique is particularly important in determining the background to the high harmonics emitted by the atom.},

	abstract = {We present a simple, one-dimensional model of an atom exposed to a time-dependent intense, short-pulse EM field with the objective of teaching undergraduates how to apply various numerical methods to study the behavior of this system as it evolves in time using several time propagation schemes. In this model, the exact Coulomb potential is replaced by a soft-core interaction to avoid the singularity at the origin. While the model has some drawbacks, it has been shown to be a reasonable representation of what occurs in the fully three-dimensional hydrogen atom. The model can be used as a tool to train undergraduate physics majors in the art of computation and software development.
Program summary
Program Title: 1d hydrogen light interaction Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/2275fmvdzc.1 Code Ocean Capsule: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1476487.v1 Licensing provisions: MIT license Programming language: FORTRAN90 Nature of problem: The one dimensional time dependent Schrödinger equation has been shown to be quite useful as a model to study the Hydrogen atom exposed to an intense, short pulse, electromagnetic field. We use a model potential that is cut-off near x=0 and avoids the singularity of the true 1-D potential, but retains the characteristic Rydberg series and continuum to study excitation and ionization of the true H atom. The code employs a number of numerical methods to understand and compare the efficacy and accuracy when applied to this model problem. Solution method: The program uses and contrasts a number of approaches; the Crank–Nicolson, Short Iterative Lanczos, various incarnations of the split-operator and the Chebychev method have been programmed. These methods have been compared using a 3-point finite difference (FD) discretization of the space coordinate. For completeness, some attention has also been given to using 5–9 FD formulas in order to show how higher order discretization affects the accuracy and efficiency of the methods but the primary focus of the method is the time propagation. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The main purpose of this code is as a teaching tool for undergraduates interested in acquiring knowledge of numerical methods and programming skills useful to a practicing computational physicist.},

	abstract = {Probing and controlling electrons and nuclei in matter at the attosecond timescale became possible with the generation of attosecond pulses by few-cycle intense lasers, and has revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure and molecular processes. This book provides an intuitive approach to this emerging field, utilizing simplified models to develop a clear understanding of how matter interacts with attosecond pulses of light. An introductory chapter outlines the structure of atoms and molecules and the properties of a focused laser beam. Detailed discussion of the fundamental theory of attosecond and strong-field physics follows, including the molecular tunnelling ionization model (MO-ADK theory), the quantitative rescattering (QRS) model, and the laser induced electronic diffraction (LIED) theory for probing the change of atomic configurations in a molecule. Highlighting the cutting-edge developments in attosecond and strong field physics, and identifying future opportunities and challenges, this self-contained text is invaluable for students and researchers in the field.},

With this method, time marching scheme is explicit, and the nonreflecting boundary condition is automatically fulfilled.
